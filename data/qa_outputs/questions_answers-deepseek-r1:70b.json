Improved signal to noise in the process and detection equipment and in the down-stream signal processing almost always leads to an improved level of sensitivity. The questions are how much improvement is available before other limitations impinge and how to achieve any improvement most cost effectively. Of course there will always be some problems that only the last resort of newer more specialized equipment can solve, but a surprising amount of progress can be achieved before this is necessary.",

This new system, the ID/10, is designed to provide a computing engine to meet the demands of the signal processing algorithms that are operated now and those that the company might develop over the next few years. Allied to the DSP processor, an analogue input system with a 24 bit resolution and a 10msec conversion time has been developed. With regard to noise, this new A/D system is remarkably clean with better than 22 bits free of peak-to-peak noise at a nominal 100 samples per second. A typical chroma- tography integrator based on current state-of-the-art semiconductor I/C technology may claim 24 bit resolu- tion with 20 bits of noise free data, but this is normally based on 'RMS' measured noise. RMS measurements are fine for hi-fi but in chromatography where the signal shape is important, noise peaks are what show up on the chromatogram. Converting RMS noise to peak-to-peak noise (multiply RMS noise by 6\"5) indicates that the typical integrator's claimed 20 bit performance is really closer to 16 bits where every lost bit of useable resolution effectively halves the potential sensitivity.",
