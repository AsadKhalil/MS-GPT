Calvariae were agitated at 37 C for 7 minutes to release cells. The first extraction was discarded, and the process was repeated three times. Osteoblasts collected in the last three extractions were combined. Cells were plated at a density of 10 6 cells per 3.8 cm 2 in αMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin.",
