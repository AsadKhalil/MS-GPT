        "context": "Inspections of many crystallized gels yielding good and poor ion intensities for ≥ 20 kDa proteins suggested that clear, 'chopstick'-shaped crystals obtained by slow crystallization seemed to have a higher success rate, and that employing ACN:H 2 O solvent ratios below 1:1 (v/v) provided some advantage, although matrix crystallization is notoriously hard to control. Gel incubation in 1:3 ACN:H 2 O, was more likely to deliver the desired crystal form than 1:2, but crystals from the former were typically deposited sparsely (or not at all) across the gel. These observations led to the double matrix incubation described in the Methods section. Microcrystals from a first incubation in the 1:3 matrix solution (with lower sinapinic acid solubility) serve as seeds for the second crystallization from the 1:2 solution.",
        "question": "Why were microcrystals from the first incubation used as seeds for the second crystallization?",
        "answer": "Because they provided a basis for further crystallization, likely due to differences in sinapinic acid solubility between the two solutions"

        "context": "One of the first requirements to improving noise performance is to understand the sources of noise within the overall system. From the chemical point of view, noise can arise from a wide variety of sources including contamination, process interaction and changes in the process environment. Careful attention to the detail of process design will minimize the chemical noise presented to the detector. At a system level, chromatography is also an inherently noisy process. Irregularities in the eluent pressure and flow rate, thermal effects, and column binding effects, all conspire to provide the detector with a noisy signal. Again attention to detail and equipment set-up can help minimize these effects. Once at the detector the detection process itself is generally inherently noisy. In gas chromatography the nominal flame ioniza- tion detector is extremely noisy, with carrier gas im- purities and pressure variations, thermal effects, high voltage power supply noise and ionization noise. In liquid chromatography, UV detectors are subject to stray light, cell contamination, source fluctuation, source ageing effects and sensor shot noise.

        "context": "There are many different approaches to digital signal processing. All, however, are based on the sampling of the analogue signal on a regular basis via an analogue- to-digital converter. At the simplest level, the signal processing can be just 'bunching' where the signal is over-sampled by a factor of N and N samples are accumulated and averaged to produce the user's sample rate. This simple technique is the basis of many of the high resolution sigma-delta A/D converters used in today's chromatography data collection systems.
