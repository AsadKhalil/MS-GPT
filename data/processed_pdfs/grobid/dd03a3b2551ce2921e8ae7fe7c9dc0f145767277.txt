In the 2013 evaluation report of the FAO/WHO Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR), fenpyroximate was defined as fenpyroximate (E-fenpyroximate) for the risk assessment
The objectives of the present study were as follows: (1) To establish a simple and accurate method of QuEChERS combined with UHPLC-MS/MS to measure fenpyroximate and its Z-isomer in citrus;
