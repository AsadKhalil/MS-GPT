Synthesis of heparin immobilized-magnetically addressable cellulose nanofibers for biomedical applications

Composite fibers digested using heparinase I,II and III enzyme overnight and the resulting disaccharide mixture was then passed through a column to achieve chromatographic separation. Finally, the eluates were subjected to mass spectrometry.  All the composite fibers (Cellulose-Magnetite-Heparin monofilament fibers, Cellulose-Magnetite-Heparin core-shell fibers and Cellulose/Heparin Magnetite core-shell fibers) showed all the disaccharide peaks correspond to the disaccharide peaks of the heparin standard.

fibers (Shows two small peaks at 1207 cm-1and 1411 cm-1 that correspond to S=O 
symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations respectively)

Figure S6. The EDX spectrum of Cellulose-Magnetite core-shell fibers showed a 
small peak around 1.74 keV. This is due to the to the silicon present inside the SiLi 
detector.

Figure S7. The EDX spectra of all of the heparin containing fibers showed 
characteristic peaks for sulfur confirming the presence of heparin on the fiber
