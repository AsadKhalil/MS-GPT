Bovine mastitis is the foremost endemic infectious disease of dairy cattle worldwide, as well as in our country. Mastitis is responsible for major economic losses to dairy producers and the milk processing industry, resulting in reduced milk production, alteration in milk composition, discarded milk, increased replacement costs, treatment costs, and veterinary services
Mastitis, the inflammation of the mammary gland, usually a consequence of the adhesion, invasion, and colonization of the mammary gland by mastitis pathogens, exists in three forms: clinical, subclinical, and chronic mastitis
The etiology of mastitis includes contagious microorganisms that survive and proliferate on the skin and teat wounds, as well as environmental microorganisms that are not retained on the teat
Previously, studies had documented major pathogens of mastitis such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and coliforms
The main treatment of mastitis is commonly administered by intramammary infusion or parenteral administration of antibiotics, such as streptomycin, ampicillin, cloxacillin, penicillin, and tetracycline
The prompt identification and understanding of the diversity of the pathogens associated with mastitis is essential for effective prevention and control
The purpose of this study was to estimate the distribution of pathogens associated with clinical and subclinical mastitis and to determine their antimicrobial resistance patterns, in a random selection of dairy farms in the western part of Romania. To the authors' knowledge, there is a lack of data on potential regional differences in the prevalence of different mastitis pathogens and their antimicrobial resistance in Romania.
Cattle with clinical mastitis and subclinical mastitis were observed at all of the farms included in this study; samples from SCM cases represented 90% of the total number of samples that were collected. Clinical mastitis (CM) cases were obviously lower in all studied farms. The value of χ 2 = 0.109, with a degree of freedom 3, confidence level of 95%, and p = 0.99, demonstrates that these two variables are significative associates.
The distribution of the most commonly isolated genera was: Staphylococcus spp., 43.1%; Streptococcus spp., 22.42%; E. coli, 13.79%; Enterococcus spp., 8.62%; Corynebacterium spp., 7.75%; and Enterobacter spp., 4.31% (Table
The identified species of coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) represented 64% of all isolated Staphylococcus species as it follows:
-S. aureus, twenty-four strains (48.0%); -S. intermedius, six strains (12%); -S. hycus subsp. hycus, two strains (4%);
Mahmoud et al.
The presence of a lower number of CPS strains other than S. aureus was observed in the literature by other researchers
In our study, CNS-S. hycus, S. chromogenes, S. xylosus, and S. capitis-were identified with a lower proportion, and represented 36% (18/50) of the number of staphylococci isolated strains and 15.51% (18/116) of the total of isolated strains.
From the streptococci group, we isolated and identified thirteen strains of Str. Agalactiae, considered a species with major pathogenicity, six strains of Str. uberis, four strains of Str. dysgalactiae and ten strains of Enterococcus spp. The streptococci group represented 22.41% (26/116) and enterococci represented 8.62% (10/116) of all isolated strains.
Corynebacterium bovis and Corynebacterium spp. were isolated in a proportion of 7.75% of all isolates identified in this study. Most strains were isolated from SCM (7/9; 77.77%).
In this study, E. coli represented 13.79% (16/116), and Enterobacter aerogenes and E. cloacae represented 4.31% of all isolated strains.
All 24 of the isolated CPS and CNS strains were found to be resistant to at least four antimicrobial agents. The isolated strains showed multiple resistance. Resistance was observed for ampicillin
S. hycus subsp.
S. capitis
Amoxicillinclavulanic acid
The phenomenon of multiple resistance to the tested antimicrobial substances was noted, in the present research, in which out of the 24 staphylococci strains tested for antibiotic resistance, 21 isolates (87.5%) presented multiple resistance: eight (33.3%) strains were resistant to four antimicrobials, four (16.66%) to five antimicrobials, five (20.83%) to six antimicrobials, two (8.33%) to seven antimicrobials, and two (8.33%) to eight antimicrobials.
Behavior towards antimicrobials was tested for 14 of the strains of streptococci isolated from milk samples, the culture medium being supplemented with sheep blood, for safe and clear growth.
All 16 of the isolated streptococci strains were found to be resistant to almost all 14 antimicrobials tested (Table
None of the isolates were sensitive for all antimicrobials, an aspect also observed by others
The phenomenon of multiple resistance to the tested antimicrobials was also noticed in the enterococci strains where four (66.6%) strains showed this phenomenon, as follows: one strain (16.6%) was resistant to four antimicrobials, one strain (16.6%) to six antimicrobials, one strain (16.6%) to seven antimicrobials, and one strain (16.6%) to all ten of the antimicrobials tested.
In E. coli strains (Table
Our study agrees with the results of previous investigations
S. aureus remain the main species identified in mastitis. According to different authors, S. aureus was isolated in up to 40% of mastitis cases in China
In our study, S. aureus were predominantly isolated from monomicrobial mastitis and S. intermedius was isolated only in monomicrobial mastitis. The occurrence of S. intermedius mastitis has been an increasing problem in Turkey. Additionally, the first report of a brain abscess in a human due to S. intermedius was mentioned in literature
In SCM cases, S. aures was isolated in association with streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, and Corynebacterium bovis.
In a study conducted by Wald et al.
The prevalence of mastitis produced by Str. agalactiae mentioned in the literature is variable, between 6.8% and 14.4%
Gram-negative bacteria, mostly coliforms, including E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter spp., cause a high proportion of all clinical mastitis (CM) cases
The low proportion of Gram-negative microorganisms isolated from the mastitis cases studied is indirectly proportional to the increased frequency of major pathogens (S. aureus, Str. agalactiae) involved in the etiology of mastitis in cows. This aspect observed in the present study is in concordance with the literature
Antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem in cow mastitis. Antimicrobial resistance helps bacteria stay alive after treatment with antibiotics, and some of the mechanisms of resistance include the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes that can spread by horizontal transfer from bacteria to bacteria with mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, phages, and pathogenicity islands, or through random mutations when the bacteria are under stress
Some authors noted that in the therapy of mastitis caused by staphylococci sensitive to penicillins, it is recommended to administer β-lactam antimicrobials (especially penicillin G), and as an alternative treatment, cloxacillin, macrolides, and lincosamides can be used. The same authors do not recommend the use of fourth generation cephalosporins as an alternative treatment, as they may generate strains resistant to broad-spectrum βlactams
All 12 Staphylococcus spp. isolates tested with methicillin, amoxicillin, and rifampicin demonstrate a total resistance to methicillin, which is a real concern for animal and human health. Staphylococcus methicillin resistance (MRSA) is one significant problem in society, being demonstrated that these strains can be transmitted to humans. Milk and milk producers may act as a reservoir of MRSA. An early determination of methicillin resistance is of crucial importance in the prognosis of S. aureus infections
The Staphylococcus isolates were resistant to eight antimicrobials from the 14 tested. Literature mentioned the in vitro biofilm forming abilities of S. aureus and S. epidermidis isolates from bovine mastitis cases
Quinn et al.
A clear difference between our results and those from other studies is the much higher proportion of environmental pathogens in many other countries. In studies in the UK, Str. uberis were the species most commonly isolated, followed by Enterobacter, while in Finland
Monitoring antimicrobial resistance patterns of bacterial isolates from cases of mastitis is important for treatment decisions. The prudent use of antimicrobials in dairy farms reduces the emergence, persistence, and spread of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial strains and resistome from farms to animals, humans, and the environment.
The data from this study revealed that MRSA isolates are present among S. aures strains, which is a real concern for both animal and human health. Staphylococcus methicillin resistance is one significant problem in society, being demonstrated that these strains can be transmitted to human resistance. The need to implement the One Health concept is more urgent than ever, if we contemplate the interconnections between humans, animals, animal products, and the environment.
The multiple resistance phenomena observed in a high number of isolates require discern in the choice of mastitis treatment, considering both the health of the animal, the increase of productivity, but also the ease of transmitting bacteria from milk to humans. For this reason, the testing of antimicrobial sensitivities are strongly recommended.
We hypothesized that resistance pathotypes were more prevalent in the studied farms, not only due to exposure to a higher number of antibiotics, but also due to the greater frequency of isolation of bacterial strains with an increased resistance to antibiotics.
A total of 127 lactating cows in a random selection of 4 farms located in the western part of Romania were included in the present study (Table
A cross-sectional study was used to screen mastitis in lactating dairy cows from 1 May-30 September 2021. The sample size was determined according to Thrusfield
The main criteria for inclusion in this study were:
1.
Presence of signs of udder inflammation: redness, hotness, pain at local palpation.
Obvious changes in milk (milk consistency, presence of blood, clots, and flakes).
Generalized clinical symptoms: fever, loss of appetite, severe udder inflammation.
These criteria made statements on the clinical mastitis diagnosis. Subclinical mastitis cases were classified, as those cows were without clinical signs, but with a high somatic cell count determined using the California mastitis test (CMT). Reagent (CMT TEST, KEPRO, Deventer, The Netherlands) was mixed with an equal volume of milk (2 mL) in a four-well paddle for 10-15 s, and the result was recorded within 20 s. Results were interpreted using a scoring system ranging from 0 to 4: 0 for no reaction, 1 for trace, 2 for weakly positive (presence of a sediment), 3 for distinctly positive (sediment and a slight increase in consistency) and 4 for strongly positive (sample is totally coagulated)
Milk samples were analyzed microbiologically using standard laboratory methods
Staphylococcus spp. were identified based on the evidence of free coagulase and the presence of the clumping factor using rapid slide agglutination tests (Bactident Coagulase, Merk, Darmstadt, Germany) and Staphytec Plus (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK). The colonies presenting phenotypical characteristics were transferred on Chapman agar (Oxoid, Basignstoke, UK) to identify pathogenic Staphylococcus strains (mannitol fermentation).
Streptococcus species were identified using the catalase test and growth characteristics on Edward's media (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) and the within group differentiation was done using the CAMP test. Gram-negative bacteria were identified based on growth on MacConkey agar, motility, and indole and oxidase tests.
The isolates were sent to the other laboratory for identification with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS).
For MALDI-TOF MS analysis, samples were prepared using a single colony of fresh overnight culture and were prepared according to standard protocol provided by the manufacturer (Bruker Daltonic, Bremen, Germany). A small amount of biological material from a single colony was smeared onto the spot of the MALDI target plate. Using the same instrument, a second spot was made on the target plate. The biological material was covered with 1 µL of matrix solution for 1 h and allowed to dry at room temperature. The target plate was then loaded on MALDI-TOF Biotyper and identified by comparing the mass spectral protein detection pattern with the reference patterns in database. A score of >0.2 was accepted as representing a reliable identification
Antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated using the disc diffusion (Kirby-Bauer) method. Briefly, representative strains of the isolated bacteria were spread on Mueller-Hinton agar plates (Difco), and their susceptibility to the following antibiotics (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) was tested. Staphylococcus spp. isolates were tested to: erythromycin (E; 30 µg/disc), polymyxin B (PB; 300 UI/disc), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (2:1) (AMC; 30 µg/disc), ampicillin (AMP; 25 µg/disc), tylozin (TY; 30 µg/disc), oxacillin (OX; 1 µg/disc), cephalothin (CH; 30 µg/disc), novobiocin (NV; 5 µg/disc), gentamicin (GEN; 10 µg/disc), neomycin (NEO; 30 µg/disc), penicillin G (PEN; 10 units/disc), streptomycin (STR; 10 µg/disc), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SXT; 25 µg/disc), kanamycin (K; 30 µg/disc) and tetracycline (TET; 30 µg/disc). Twelve of these Staphylococcus isolates were also tested to methicillin (M; 10 µg/disc-HiMedia, India), amoxicillin (AC; 20 µg/disc, HiMedia, India), and rifampicin (R; 5 µg/disc, HiMedia, India). Streptococcus spp. isolates were tested to the same antimicrobials used for staphylococci isolates except polymyxin B. There were few antibiotics which were also added: lincomycin (L; 15 µg/disc), penicillin G (P; 10 IU/disc), bacitracin (B; 30 µg/disc), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SXT; 25 µg/disc). Six strains of Enterococcus spp. were tested to erythromycin (E; 30 µg/disc), ampicillin (AMP; 25 µg/disc), tylozin (TY; 30 µg/disc), oxacillin (OX; 1 µg/disc), gentamicin (GEN; 10 µg/disc), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SXT; 25 µg/disc), kanamycin (K; 30 µg/disc), lincomycin (L; 15 µg/disc), penicillin G (P; 10 IU/disc), bacitracin (B; 30 µg/disc), and tetracycline (TET; 30 µg/disc).
E. coli isolates and Enterobacter spp. isolates were tested to: erythromycin (E; 30 µg/disc), florfenicol (FFC; 30 30 µg/disc), gentamicin (GEN; 10 µg/disc), cephalothin (CH; 30 µg/disc), tetracycline (TET; 30 µg/disc), ampicillin (AMP; 25 µg/disc), and enrofloxacin (ENR; 15 µg/disc).
The choice of antimicrobial substances for the antibiogram was mainly influenced by data from the literature
Zones of inhibition (in mm) were measured after approximately 18 h of incubation at 37 • C, and the results were interpreted following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
Quality control was performed following the guidelines specified by the CLSI (CLSI, 2008) using Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 23235 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. All susceptibility results obtained from quality control strains were within the quality control ranges.
