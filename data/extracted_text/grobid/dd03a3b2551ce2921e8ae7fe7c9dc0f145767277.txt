A pesticide residue analysis includes sample pre-treatment and sample detection. In this experiment, we used a flow injection method to inject a mixed standard solution of fenpyroximate and Z-fenpyroximate into a mass spectrometer at 1 mg/L, and the mass spectrum was scanned with the positive ionization mode (ESI+) in the MRM mode. By means of primary mass spectrometry scanning, the value of the parent ion was determined to be 422.2, and the value of the declustering potential (DP) was optimized so that strongest signal occurred at 90 V. The values of the pieces were determined to be 366.1 and 135.0 using product ion scanning. The collision energy (CE) of the mass spectrometry was optimized to maximize the response of product ions at 23 V and 43 V, respectively. In order to separate the fenpyroximate and Z-fenpyroximate as much as possible, a slow flow rate of 0.2 mL min -1 was set. Using a single-pesticide standard solution for full scanning, the retention times of fenpyroximate and its Z-isomer were determined to be 2.71 and 2.28, respectively, under the mass spectrometry conditions (Table
In order to analyze the experimental samples accurately, the main parameter indicators of the analysis methods for the two pesticides in whole fruits and citrus flesh were validated and evaluated; these parameters included linearity, matrix effect, accuracy, precision, and sensitivity.
Fenpyroximate and its Z-isomer in two matrixes were verified using linearity, the correlation coefficient (R 2 ), and the LOQ. As can be seen in Table

To evaluate the accuracy and precision of the detection method, a recovery test was used to calculate the average recovery and relative standard deviation (RSD) for each of the two tested compounds in both whole fruit and citrus flesh. The results are shown in Table
Matrix effects (MEs) should be avoided as much as possible when using UHPLC-MS/MS for residue determination
For the terminal residue experiment, fenpyroximate was applied once to citrus from all twelve fields at the registered high dosage (56 mg kg -1 ). The terminal residues of the samples were collected at 15 and 25 days after application, and the total residues of fenpyroximate were calculated. The results are shown in Tables
Throughout the experiment, in both whole fruit and citrus flesh, the residual concentrations of fenpyroximate, Z-fenpyroximate, as well as total residues all exhibited a decreasing trend with increases in the harvest interval. In a small number of cases, the residue concentrations after long intervals were slightly higher than the corresponding short-interval values; however, this may have been the result of uneven sampling, quartering, or scaling during sample preparation so that the experimental results were not affected. The residual concentrations of fenpyroximate in citrus flesh were lower than those in entire fruits because droplets of pesticides wholly adhered to the surface of the citrus peel after application. The total residues of fenpyroximate in whole fruit and citrus flesh were all derived from fenpyroximate because the chemical configuration of fenpyroximate in plants gives it an advantage compared to Z-fenpyroximate
The long-term dietary risk assessment was based on data from monitoring surveys on the nutritional and health status of Chinese residents; these were combined with STMR or MRL so that a national estimated daily intake (NEDI) could be determined. This was used to evaluate the dietary intake risk posed by edible parts of foods such as citrus flesh. At present, based on the data from the Chinese pesticide information network, the crops which are registered for fenpyroximate in China include maize, citrus, apple, and lycium
The short-term dietary risk posed by fenpyroximate after the intake of citrus was assessed for two different groups (children aged 1-6 years, and the general population aged >6 years). According to data from the World Health Organization
The fenpyroximate standard (Solid, purity 97.79%) and Z-fenpyroximate standard (liquid, 100.0 µg mL -1 ) were provided by Dr. Ehrenstorfer (Augsburg, Germany). The 28% suspension concentrate (SC) of fenpyroximate was supplied by Shanxi Huarongkaiwei Biotech Co., Ltd. (Xi'an, China). Formic acid and chromatographic-grade methanol were purchased from Merck AG (Darmstadt, Germany) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China), respectively. Acetonitrile and HPLC-grade ammonium acetate were purchased from Tiandi Co., Ltd. (Dublin, OH, USA) and the Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute (Tianjin, China), respectively. Analytical-grade sodium chloride was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Purification tubes of 2 mL capacity (150 mg anhydrous MgSO 4 , 50 mg PSA, and 5 mg GCB) were purchased from Shimadzu Jier Trading Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
A standard stock solution of fenpyroximate was prepared by weighing 10.0 mg of the fenpyroximate standard and then dissolving it with acetonitrile in a 100 mL volumetric flask. The standard stock solutions of fenpyroximate and Z-fenpyroximate 100 µg mL -1 were all stored in a freezer at -18 • C.
We placed 0.1 mL of fenpyroximate and Z-fenpyroximate in a 10 mL volumetric flask with acetonitrile to prepare a mixed standard solution of 10 µg mL -1 . The mixed standard solution was serially diluted with whole fruit and citrus flesh at concentrations of 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 µg mL -1 . All solutions were stored in a dark place at 4 • C.
In line with the guideline requirements for the testing of pesticide residues in crops (NY/T 788-2018)
In order to measure the levels of terminal and dissipation residue of fenpyroximate and its Z-isomer, a dosage of 56 mg kg -1 fenpyroximate SC (a registered high dosage in citrus) was applied once to the citrus. Terminal residue samples of the whole fruit and citrus flesh were collected 15 d and 25 d after application. Two independent samples were collected, each involving at least 12 fruits randomly chosen from different places on the tree.
Samples were cut into pieces of less than 1 cm 2 and then mixed and divided into pieces of 150 g weight by means of quartering. All samples were stored at -20 • C in preparation for testing.
A QuEChERS-based method
Chromatographic conditions: UHPLC-MS/MS analyses of fenpyroximate and its Z-isomer were carried out using SCIEX Triple Quad 4500 (AB company, Framingham, MA, USA). The chromatographic column was ACQUITY UPLC ® BEH 1.7 µm C18 100 A (100 × 2.1 mm, SN: 02973711615165). The temperatures of the column and sample plate were 30 • C and 20 • C, respectively. The mobile phase was composed of 90% aqueous phase (4 mmol L -1 ammonium acetate aqueous solution with 0.1% formic acid) and 10% organic phase (pure methanol), flowing at 0.2 mL min -1 . The injection volume was 2 µL.
Mass spectrum conditions: The mass spectrum was scanned at positive ionization mode (ESI+) in MRM mode. The ionization voltage was 5500 V, the ion source temperature was 550 • C, and the collision gas was nitrogen. The other mass-spectrometry parameters for fenpyroximate and its Z-isomer are shown in Table
The analytical methods used for fenpyroximate and Z-fenpyroximate in whole fruit and citrus flesh were verified with respect to linearity, matrix effect (ME), accuracy, precision, and sensitivity, in conformity with SANTE/11312/2021
Three levels of mixed standard solutions (0.01, 0.1, and 0.2 mg kg -1 ) were added to blank matrixes of whole fruit and citrus flesh, so that the recovery and relative standard deviation (RSD) values could be calculated for the target compounds, enabling the accuracy and precision of the method to be evaluated. In order to cover the maximum detected concentration among the testing samples, we added a concentration of 0.5 mg kg -1 to the whole fruit matrix. Five repeated tests were carried out for each level. The recovery rate of the method was found to be 70-120%, and the RSD was less than 20%, which was considered a satisfactory degree of accuracy. Usually, the lowest spiked level was set as the limit of quantification (LOQ) to evaluate the sensitivity of the method.
As reported in the literature
where K m and K s are the slopes of the matrix-matched standard curve and the solvent standard curve, respectively. An ion suppression percentage of 0 indicates no matrix effect; an ion suppression percentage of more than 0 indicates that the sample matrix has a matrix-enhancing effect on the determination of the target compound; and ion suppression percentages of less than 0 indicates a matrix-inhibiting effect on the determination of the target compound.
For plant commodities, in line with the JMPR research results, the residue was defined as fenpyroximate for compliance with MRLs, and for the dietary risk assessment as the sum of the parent fenpyroximate and its Z-isomer (M-1), expressed as fenpyroximate and calculated directly using addition
The method for assessing long-term dietary intake risk was recommended by the review committee of the National Pesticide Residue Standards. The risk quotient (RQ c ) was used to represent the long-term dietary intake risk, and the calculation formulas were as follows
where NEDI (mg kg -1 bw) refers to the national estimated daily intake; STMR i (mg kg -1 ) is the median residue of total fenpyroximate (the sum of fenpyroximate and Z-fenpyroximate) in citrus flesh collected from field trials; F i (kg d -1 ) is the per capita daily consumption of citrus in China; bw (kg) is the average weight of Chinese adults; ADI (mg kg -1 bw) is the allowable daily intake of fenpyroximate taken as determined by the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting of Pesticide Residues (JMPR)
Assessment of short-term dietary intake risk was calculated in line with case 2a of the JMPR-recommended method using the following formulas
RQ a = NESTI/ArfD × 100%
In this study, a qualitative and quantitative method of analysis was established to detect fenpyroximate and its Z-isomer in whole-fruit and flesh citrus. This method was found to be simple, time-saving, effective in purification, sensitive, and accurate. This method is characterized by an excellent linear relationship, with levels of accuracy and precision which meet the requirements for detection and analysis of pesticide residues. Using this method, we obtained a short-term separation of fenpyroximate and its Z-isomer, and the effect of the separation was good. The terminal residues of fenpyroximate in whole-fruit and flesh citrus collected from twelve fields were <0.010-0.18 and <0.010-0.063 mg kg -1 , respectively, which were lower than the Chinese MRL values. The terminal residues of fenpyroximate (the sum of fenpyroximate and Z-fenpyroximate) in whole-fruit and flesh citrus were <0.020-0.19 and <0.020-0.053 mg kg -1 , respectively, and RQ c and RQ a were 3.98% and 10.6-27.5%, respectively, i.e., less than 100%, indicating that the levels of long-
