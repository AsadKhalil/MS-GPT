The surface modification of diamond is an effective means of controlling its physical/chemical properties, i.e., biological affinity, friction, electrical/electrochemical properties, wettability
Authors and our group successfully induced diamond semiconductors for a no-gateinsulator SGFET (electrolyte-solution-gate field-effect transistor) utilizing a single-crystal di-amond
Here, to overcome the above-mentioned issues, we propose a "fluorine gas direct treatment method" utilizing fluorine gas (F 2 gas) for the fabrication of a no-gate-insulator diamond SGFET sensor with a smaller amount of unexpectedly generated fluorocarbon film. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) were used to investigate the state of the fluorohydrocarbon film on the surface of the C-F diamond, and the current-voltage (IV) characteristics of the diamond FETs created by the fluorine gas direct treatment were also evaluated.
Highly (110)-oriented polycrystalline diamonds that were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) were used in this study. The typical specification of the (110) diamond is described in our previous study
To obtain the C-F diamond surface with a smaller amount of unexpectedly generated C x F y film, a F 2 gas treatment was introduced, where some of the experiments were conducted in collaboration with the F-Technical Assistance Center, TAKAMATSU TEISAN Corporation. Figure
For comparison, conventional ICP treatment with perfluoropropane gas (C 3 F 8 gas) was applied for the fabrication of C-F diamonds under pressure of 3 Pa and the gas flow of 20 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) with 100-500 W for up to 30 s. To characterize the C-F diamond surface as an SGFET sensor, a boron-doped diamond (BDD) SGFET was fabricated in the same process described in our previous works
A Model 3300 X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS; ULVAC-Phi) device was used for the identification of chemical bonds (C-F, C-O, C-N) on the diamond surface. The functional groups on the diamond were also analyzed by using a Model TRIFT III TOF-SIMS (ULVAC PHI) device. The typical conditions were as follows: the primary ion source was gallium ions; the ion irradiation time was 300 s; the impact energy was 15 kV; the measured mass range was 0.1-200; the mass resolution was 500 at m/z; and the lateral resolution was 22 μm. Curve fitting of XPS spectra was performed with the analysis software Origin.
The C-F BDD SGFETs were characterized using a measurement system comprising two sets of Model 2400 source-measure units (Keithley Instruments, Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA) and/or two sets of Model GS820 source-measure units (Yokogawa Electric Corp., Tokyo, Japan) for the gate-source voltage (Vgs) and the application of the drain-source voltage (Vds) with common-source mode. Labview 2010 (National Instruments Inc., Austin, TX, USA) was used to control the process and obtain the I-V data. The gate-source voltage was applied via a silver-silver chloride gate electrode (Ag/AgCl electrode). SGFET I-V profiles were obtained at room temperature (approximately 20 degrees C). All chemicals used in this study were of reagent grade and were obtained from Wako, Kanto Kagaku, Tokyo Kasei, and Horiba. Additionally, 1 mM phosphate-buffered saline buffer solution (PBS; pH 7.4) was used for the evaluation.
To evaluate the diamond surfaces after the F2 reaction, the fluorine functional groups on the C-F diamond surfaces were analyzed using XPS with a monochromated Al K Xray source. The coverage of fluorine (F1s; 688 eV) was estimated from the deconvolution

To evaluate the diamond surfaces after the F 2 reaction, the fluorine functional groups on the C-F diamond surfaces were analyzed using XPS with a monochromated Al K X-ray source. The coverage of fluorine (F1s; 688 eV) was estimated from the deconvolution of the C 1s peak intensity. The wide spectra in Figure
gen species existing on the C-F diamond surface may be attributed to physio-adsorbed oxygen after several days of exposure to the air following the C-F treatment. No additional treatment was performed to remove the physio-adsorbed oxygen effect prior to the XPS analysis. The main peak near 284.5 eV is the C 1s peak. The F 1s peak at 688 eV in the spectrum of the F2 direct fluorination confirms the surface fluorination of the diamond films. The deconvolutions of the C 1s spectra on the F2 direct fluorination are shown in Figure
For a feasibility study of C-F BDD SGFET as a chemical sensor, the FET currentvoltage (FET I-V) characterization of the C-F BDD SGFET was examined with respect to the C-H BDD SGFET. Initially, the SGFETs and an Ag-AgCl gate electrode (the reference electrode) were washed with ultrapure water and then immersed in a 1 M PBS buffer solution (pH 7.4) for 30 min before their FET I-V characteristics were evaluated using a common-source method via drain-source current (Ids)-gate-source (Vgs) characteristics (the so-called static characteristics). Figure
Even though the Vth (threshold voltage) shifted by 0.8 V in the negative direction due to the partial fluorine termination, nearly ideal Vds-Ids characteristics according to the metal-oxide-silicon semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) theory, which describes the Ids as being proportional to the square of the difference between Vgs and Vth, Ids ∞ (Vgs -Vth) 2 , were obtained for both the C-F BDD SGFET and the C-H BDD SGFET. The 0.8 V shift was preserved at larger Vgs, as shown in Figure
In this study, a fluorination treatment method for diamonds and a fabrication method for C-F BDD SGFET with a smaller amount of unexpected fluorocarbon film via the introduction of a F2 gas direct reaction were proposed. In comparison to conventional ICP fluorination, the F2 gas efficiently reacts with the C-H bond and a fluorocarbon film does not exist or only exists in small amounts on the surface. In addition to a further study of the ion sensitivity of C-F BDD SGFET, long-term characteristics, in addition to shortterm characteristics, and the interference of cations/anions/chemicals are to be examined from an application perspective.
