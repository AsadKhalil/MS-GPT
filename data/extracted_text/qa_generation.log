图6-b, c, d)。与金属元素不 同, 非金属元素 P 在腹沟维管组织的浓度很低, 与 胚乳部位几乎没有差异(图5-c, 图6-a)。比较元素的 连续分布可清楚地发现, 籽粒不同部位各元素(P、 Mn、Cu和Zn)浓度的动态变化表现出明显的同步性: 某一元素浓度高的部位其他元素的浓度亦高(图5和 图 6), 说明本试验所测元素在籽粒中存在明显的共 分布特征。 3 讨论 近年来, LA-ICP-MS 测定植物籽粒中元素含量 和分布已有几例报道。Meharg等[18]利用LA-ICP-MS 对糙米中 As 的分析表明, As 主要分布于糙米外层, 学 报 第38卷 MS测定的糊粉层及胚乳不同位置(b) e layer and endosperm at different positions from the aleurone layer (b) 粒外周胚乳;

Wirth 等[16]利用 LA-ICP-MS 证实转基 因(烟酰胺合成酶和铁蛋白)水稻籽粒中 Fe 含量高于 野生型水稻籽粒, 并且发现野生型稻米中铁的分布 均匀, 而转基因稻米中铁的分布不均匀。测定中发 现稻米样品中含铁较高的点很可能是铁蛋白在有限 空间积累的结果; Wang 等[12]利用小麦离体穗培养, 结合稳定同位素70Zn的使用, 采用LA-ICP-MS技术 对小麦籽粒锌浓度的空间分布定量研究发现, 提高 锌处理水平, 锌向胚乳中转运的效率降低, 可能与 锌进入胚乳的两大障碍有关, 这两大障碍分别位于 小穗轴与籽粒连接点以及籽粒腹沟维管组织与胚乳 之间; 我们曾采用LA-ICP-MS和酸消解溶液雾化进 样, 以 ICP-MS 法测定自制校正标准样和小麦整粒 种子的锌浓度, 发现这 2 种方法的测定结果很接近 且重复间变异较小, 证实LA-ICP-MS这一空间分布 定量分析方法的可靠性[17]。但是以上研究均为利用 LA-ICP-MS 对单一元素测定, 还未见同时对多种元 素空间分布定量分析的报道。 锌被认为是人类最易缺乏的微量营养物质[3]。 本研究发现, 成熟麦粒锌浓度的空间分布差异非常 明显, 糊粉层和胚的锌浓度分别是胚乳锌浓度的 42第3期 王云霞等: 用激光剥蚀电感耦合等离 图5 LA-ICP-MS测得各元素在 Fig. 5 Counts per second (CPS) of eleme a为小麦籽粒横切片, 黑色箭头示激光剥蚀取样位置及方向;

图 1-b 为扣除各元素信号强度背景值后计算出的 P、 Mn、Cu 和 Zn 与 13C 的比值。13C 作为内标以消除 质谱随时间的信号强度变化和剥蚀量的差异。根据 校正标准样元素浓度和元素与 13C 的信号强度比值, 得到各元素浓度和对应元素与 13C 信号强度比值的 函数关系, y =0.75x+0.0031, R2=1.0000; y =51.445x+ P Mn 7.1219, R2=0.9996;

图6-b, c, d)。与金属元素不 同, 非金属元素 P 在腹沟维管组织的浓度很低, 与 胚乳部位几乎没有差异(图5-c, 图6-a)。比较元素的 连续分布可清楚地发现, 籽粒不同部位各元素(P、 Mn、Cu和Zn)浓度的动态变化表现出明显的同步性: 某一元素浓度高的部位其他元素的浓度亦高(图5和 图 6), 说明本试验所测元素在籽粒中存在明显的共 分布特征。 3 讨论 近年来, LA-ICP-MS 测定植物籽粒中元素含量 和分布已有几例报道。Meharg等[18]利用LA-ICP-MS 对糙米中 As 的分析表明, As 主要分布于糙米外层, 学 报 第38卷 MS测定的糊粉层及胚乳不同位置(b) e layer and endosperm at different positions from the aleurone layer (b) 粒外周胚乳;

Wirth 等[16]利用 LA-ICP-MS 证实转基 因(烟酰胺合成酶和铁蛋白)水稻籽粒中 Fe 含量高于 野生型水稻籽粒, 并且发现野生型稻米中铁的分布 均匀, 而转基因稻米中铁的分布不均匀。测定中发 现稻米样品中含铁较高的点很可能是铁蛋白在有限 空间积累的结果; Wang 等[12]利用小麦离体穗培养, 结合稳定同位素70Zn的使用, 采用LA-ICP-MS技术 对小麦籽粒锌浓度的空间分布定量研究发现, 提高 锌处理水平, 锌向胚乳中转运的效率降低, 可能与 锌进入胚乳的两大障碍有关, 这两大障碍分别位于 小穗轴与籽粒连接点以及籽粒腹沟维管组织与胚乳 之间; 我们曾采用LA-ICP-MS和酸消解溶液雾化进 样, 以 ICP-MS 法测定自制校正标准样和小麦整粒 种子的锌浓度, 发现这 2 种方法的测定结果很接近 且重复间变异较小, 证实LA-ICP-MS这一空间分布 定量分析方法的可靠性[17]。但是以上研究均为利用 LA-ICP-MS 对单一元素测定, 还未见同时对多种元 素空间分布定量分析的报道。 锌被认为是人类最易缺乏的微量营养物质[3]。 本研究发现, 成熟麦粒锌浓度的空间分布差异非常 明显, 糊粉层和胚的锌浓度分别是胚乳锌浓度的 42第3期 王云霞等: 用激光剥蚀电感耦合等离 图5 LA-ICP-MS测得各元素在 Fig. 5 Counts per second (CPS) of eleme a为小麦籽粒横切片, 黑色箭头示激光剥蚀取样位置及方向;

图 1-b 为扣除各元素信号强度背景值后计算出的 P、 Mn、Cu 和 Zn 与 13C 的比值。13C 作为内标以消除 质谱随时间的信号强度变化和剥蚀量的差异。根据 校正标准样元素浓度和元素与 13C 的信号强度比值, 得到各元素浓度和对应元素与 13C 信号强度比值的 函数关系, y =0.75x+0.0031, R2=1.0000; y =51.445x+ P Mn 7.1219, R2=0.9996; y =121.87x+0.3701, R2=0.9999; Cu y =559.05x−2.5931, R2=1.0000。其中y为元素浓度, Zn x为对应元素与13C信号强度比值。根据这一关系以 及样品中元素与 13C 的信号强度比值可推算样品的 元素浓度。 2.2 籽粒不同部位的元素浓度 将样品放入剥蚀池后, 首先用系统高分辨率成 像光学系统对样品表面形貌进行图像采集(图 2-a), 然后即可方便地在图片上选择测定部位。图 2 为小 麦籽粒各部位的软件主窗口屏幕截图, 分别代表籽 粒横切面(图2-a)、糊粉层和胚乳(图2-b)、胚(图2-c) 图1 LA-ICP-MS标准样品中P、Mn、Cu、Zn Fig. 1 Signal intensities of P, Mn, Cu, Zn, and 13C (a) and the rat 学 报 第38卷 和盾片(图2-d)。激光沿着操作者指定部位(长度300~ 500 µm、宽度50 µm的直线, 图1中黄线所围区域 所示, 下同)自动进行剥蚀取样, 剥蚀样品通过氩气 传输到 ICP-MS, 经分析后给出各元素的信号值 (CPS, counts per second)。 用 LA-ICP-MS 测定小麦籽粒糊粉层、胚(盾片) 和胚乳(图2)的锌浓度(图3), 其中每一样品数值为 300~500 µm 扫描路径上的 46~78 个连续测定值的 均值, 即每6.45 µm获得一个数据。由图3可知, P、 Mn、Cu 和 Zn 的浓度在糊粉层分别为 16.4、80.9、 25.8和347.4 mg kg1, 胚中分别为8.4、150.1、7.9 和195.8 mg kg1, 而胚乳中分别为0.6、8.7、2.1和 8.4 mg kg1。可见小麦成熟种子中元素的空间分布很 不均匀, 主要分布在胚(Mn)或胚乳四周的糊粉层(P、 Cu和Zn), 而胚乳中的浓度很低。P、Mn、Cu和Zn 最高和最低浓度分别相差33、9、15和42倍。 盾片是籽粒胚外侧连接胚乳的组织(图2-a, d)。 盾片部位 P、Mn、Cu和 Zn浓度比胚轴对应元素的 浓度分别增加141% (图3-a)、83% (图3-b)、295% (图 3-c)和12% (图3-d), 均达显著水平。说明籽粒胚不 同位置的元素浓度亦存在较大差异。 2.3 胚乳不同位置的元素浓度 胚乳是小麦籽粒最主要的部位, 一般占籽粒总 重的 82.5%。为了解胚乳不同位置元素浓度的空间 分布, 进一步测定了腹沟维管组织一侧从外到内的 3个部位,即糊粉层、外周胚乳(靠近糊粉层)和内侧胚 乳(图 4)。与图 3结果一致, 糊粉层各元素的浓度均 大于胚乳中对应元素的浓度(表 1)。另外, 从胚乳不 同位置看, 外周胚乳的元素浓度大于内侧胚乳对应 元素的浓度, P、Mn、Cu和Zn分别增加5%、22%、 192%和176%, 除P外, 差异均达显著水平(表1)。 n和13C的信号强度(a)与元素与13C的信号比(b) tio of element to 13C (b) of the standard measured by LA-LCP-MS第3期 王云霞等: 用激光剥蚀电感耦合等离 图2 小麦种子横切面(a)及LA-ICP-MS测 Fig. 2 Cross section of wheat seed (a) and the localization of aleurone l al: 糊粉层;

图6-b, c, d)。与金属元素不 同, 非金属元素 P 在腹沟维管组织的浓度很低, 与 胚乳部位几乎没有差异(图5-c, 图6-a)。比较元素的 连续分布可清楚地发现, 籽粒不同部位各元素(P、 Mn、Cu和Zn)浓度的动态变化表现出明显的同步性: 某一元素浓度高的部位其他元素的浓度亦高(图5和 图 6), 说明本试验所测元素在籽粒中存在明显的共 分布特征。 3 讨论 近年来, LA-ICP-MS 测定植物籽粒中元素含量 和分布已有几例报道。Meharg等[18]利用LA-ICP-MS 对糙米中 As 的分析表明, As 主要分布于糙米外层, 学 报 第38卷 MS测定的糊粉层及胚乳不同位置(b) e layer and endosperm at different positions from the aleurone layer (b) 粒外周胚乳;

Wirth 等[16]利用 LA-ICP-MS 证实转基 因(烟酰胺合成酶和铁蛋白)水稻籽粒中 Fe 含量高于 野生型水稻籽粒, 并且发现野生型稻米中铁的分布 均匀, 而转基因稻米中铁的分布不均匀。测定中发 现稻米样品中含铁较高的点很可能是铁蛋白在有限 空间积累的结果; Wang 等[12]利用小麦离体穗培养, 结合稳定同位素70Zn的使用, 采用LA-ICP-MS技术 对小麦籽粒锌浓度的空间分布定量研究发现, 提高 锌处理水平, 锌向胚乳中转运的效率降低, 可能与 锌进入胚乳的两大障碍有关, 这两大障碍分别位于 小穗轴与籽粒连接点以及籽粒腹沟维管组织与胚乳 之间; 我们曾采用LA-ICP-MS和酸消解溶液雾化进 样, 以 ICP-MS 法测定自制校正标准样和小麦整粒 种子的锌浓度, 发现这 2 种方法的测定结果很接近 且重复间变异较小, 证实LA-ICP-MS这一空间分布 定量分析方法的可靠性[17]。但是以上研究均为利用 LA-ICP-MS 对单一元素测定, 还未见同时对多种元 素空间分布定量分析的报道。 锌被认为是人类最易缺乏的微量营养物质[3]。 本研究发现, 成熟麦粒锌浓度的空间分布差异非常 明显, 糊粉层和胚的锌浓度分别是胚乳锌浓度的 42第3期 王云霞等: 用激光剥蚀电感耦合等离 图5 LA-ICP-MS测得各元素在 Fig. 5 Counts per second (CPS) of eleme a为小麦籽粒横切片, 黑色箭头示激光剥蚀取样位置及方向;

图 1-b 为扣除各元素信号强度背景值后计算出的 P、 Mn、Cu 和 Zn 与 13C 的比值。13C 作为内标以消除 质谱随时间的信号强度变化和剥蚀量的差异。根据 校正标准样元素浓度和元素与 13C 的信号强度比值, 得到各元素浓度和对应元素与 13C 信号强度比值的 函数关系, y =0.75x+0.0031, R2=1.0000; y =51.445x+ P Mn 7.1219, R2=0.9996; y =121.87x+0.3701, R2=0.9999; Cu y =559.05x−2.5931, R2=1.0000。其中y为元素浓度, Zn x为对应元素与13C信号强度比值。根据这一关系以 及样品中元素与 13C 的信号强度比值可推算样品的 元素浓度。 2.2 籽粒不同部位的元素浓度 将样品放入剥蚀池后, 首先用系统高分辨率成 像光学系统对样品表面形貌进行图像采集(图 2-a), 然后即可方便地在图片上选择测定部位。图 2 为小 麦籽粒各部位的软件主窗口屏幕截图, 分别代表籽 粒横切面(图2-a)、糊粉层和胚乳(图2-b)、胚(图2-c) 图1 LA-ICP-MS标准样品中P、Mn、Cu、Zn Fig. 1 Signal intensities of P, Mn, Cu, Zn, and 13C (a) and the rat 学 报 第38卷 和盾片(图2-d)。激光沿着操作者指定部位(长度300~ 500 µm、宽度50 µm的直线, 图1中黄线所围区域 所示, 下同)自动进行剥蚀取样, 剥蚀样品通过氩气 传输到 ICP-MS, 经分析后给出各元素的信号值 (CPS, counts per second)。 用 LA-ICP-MS 测定小麦籽粒糊粉层、胚(盾片) 和胚乳(图2)的锌浓度(图3), 其中每一样品数值为 300~500 µm 扫描路径上的 46~78 个连续测定值的 均值, 即每6.45 µm获得一个数据。由图3可知, P、 Mn、Cu 和 Zn 的浓度在糊粉层分别为 16.4、80.9、 25.8和347.4 mg kg1, 胚中分别为8.4、150.1、7.9 和195.8 mg kg1, 而胚乳中分别为0.6、8.7、2.1和 8.4 mg kg1。可见小麦成熟种子中元素的空间分布很 不均匀, 主要分布在胚(Mn)或胚乳四周的糊粉层(P、 Cu和Zn), 而胚乳中的浓度很低。P、Mn、Cu和Zn 最高和最低浓度分别相差33、9、15和42倍。 盾片是籽粒胚外侧连接胚乳的组织(图2-a, d)。 盾片部位 P、Mn、Cu和 Zn浓度比胚轴对应元素的 浓度分别增加141% (图3-a)、83% (图3-b)、295% (图 3-c)和12% (图3-d), 均达显著水平。说明籽粒胚不 同位置的元素浓度亦存在较大差异。 2.3 胚乳不同位置的元素浓度 胚乳是小麦籽粒最主要的部位, 一般占籽粒总 重的 82.5%。为了解胚乳不同位置元素浓度的空间 分布, 进一步测定了腹沟维管组织一侧从外到内的 3个部位,即糊粉层、外周胚乳(靠近糊粉层)和内侧胚 乳(图 4)。与图 3结果一致, 糊粉层各元素的浓度均 大于胚乳中对应元素的浓度(表 1)。另外, 从胚乳不 同位置看, 外周胚乳的元素浓度大于内侧胚乳对应 元素的浓度, P、Mn、Cu和Zn分别增加5%、22%、 192%和176%, 除P外, 差异均达显著水平(表1)。 n和13C的信号强度(a)与元素与13C的信号比(b) tio of element to 13C (b) of the standard measured by LA-LCP-MS第3期 王云霞等: 用激光剥蚀电感耦合等离 图2 小麦种子横切面(a)及LA-ICP-MS测 Fig. 2 Cross section of wheat seed (a) and the localization of aleurone l al: 糊粉层;

Wirth 等[16]利用 LA-ICP-MS 证实转基 因(烟酰胺合成酶和铁蛋白)水稻籽粒中 Fe 含量高于 野生型水稻籽粒, 并且发现野生型稻米中铁的分布 均匀, 而转基因稻米中铁的分布不均匀。测定中发 现稻米样品中含铁较高的点很可能是铁蛋白在有限 空间积累的结果; Wang 等[12]利用小麦离体穗培养, 结合稳定同位素70Zn的使用, 采用LA-ICP-MS技术 对小麦籽粒锌浓度的空间分布定量研究发现, 提高 锌处理水平, 锌向胚乳中转运的效率降低, 可能与 锌进入胚乳的两大障碍有关, 这两大障碍分别位于 小穗轴与籽粒连接点以及籽粒腹沟维管组织与胚乳 之间; 我们曾采用LA-ICP-MS和酸消解溶液雾化进 样, 以 ICP-MS 法测定自制校正标准样和小麦整粒 种子的锌浓度, 发现这 2 种方法的测定结果很接近 且重复间变异较小, 证实LA-ICP-MS这一空间分布 定量分析方法的可靠性[17]。但是以上研究均为利用 LA-ICP-MS 对单一元素测定, 还未见同时对多种元 素空间分布定量分析的报道。 锌被认为是人类最易缺乏的微量营养物质[3]。 本研究发现, 成熟麦粒锌浓度的空间分布差异非常 明显, 糊粉层和胚的锌浓度分别是胚乳锌浓度的 42第3期 王云霞等: 用激光剥蚀电感耦合等离 图5 LA-ICP-MS测得各元素在 Fig. 5 Counts per second (CPS) of eleme a为小麦籽粒横切片, 黑色箭头示激光剥蚀取样位置及方向;

图 1-b 为扣除各元素信号强度背景值后计算出的 P、 Mn、Cu 和 Zn 与 13C 的比值。13C 作为内标以消除 质谱随时间的信号强度变化和剥蚀量的差异。根据 校正标准样元素浓度和元素与 13C 的信号强度比值, 得到各元素浓度和对应元素与 13C 信号强度比值的 函数关系, y =0.75x+0.0031, R2=1.0000; y =51.445x+ P Mn 7.1219, R2=0.9996; y =121.87x+0.3701, R2=0.9999; Cu y =559.05x−2.5931, R2=1.0000。其中y为元素浓度, Zn x为对应元素与13C信号强度比值。根据这一关系以 及样品中元素与 13C 的信号强度比值可推算样品的 元素浓度。 2.2 籽粒不同部位的元素浓度 将样品放入剥蚀池后, 首先用系统高分辨率成 像光学系统对样品表面形貌进行图像采集(图 2-a), 然后即可方便地在图片上选择测定部位。图 2 为小 麦籽粒各部位的软件主窗口屏幕截图, 分别代表籽 粒横切面(图2-a)、糊粉层和胚乳(图2-b)、胚(图2-c) 图1 LA-ICP-MS标准样品中P、Mn、Cu、Zn Fig. 1 Signal intensities of P, Mn, Cu, Zn, and 13C (a) and the rat 学 报 第38卷 和盾片(图2-d)。激光沿着操作者指定部位(长度300~ 500 µm、宽度50 µm的直线, 图1中黄线所围区域 所示, 下同)自动进行剥蚀取样, 剥蚀样品通过氩气 传输到 ICP-MS, 经分析后给出各元素的信号值 (CPS, counts per second)。 用 LA-ICP-MS 测定小麦籽粒糊粉层、胚(盾片) 和胚乳(图2)的锌浓度(图3), 其中每一样品数值为 300~500 µm 扫描路径上的 46~78 个连续测定值的 均值, 即每6.45 µm获得一个数据。由图3可知, P、 Mn、Cu 和 Zn 的浓度在糊粉层分别为 16.4、80.9、 25.8和347.4 mg kg1, 胚中分别为8.4、150.1、7.9 和195.8 mg kg1, 而胚乳中分别为0.6、8.7、2.1和 8.4 mg kg1。可见小麦成熟种子中元素的空间分布很 不均匀, 主要分布在胚(Mn)或胚乳四周的糊粉层(P、 Cu和Zn), 而胚乳中的浓度很低。P、Mn、Cu和Zn 最高和最低浓度分别相差33、9、15和42倍。 盾片是籽粒胚外侧连接胚乳的组织(图2-a, d)。 盾片部位 P、Mn、Cu和 Zn浓度比胚轴对应元素的 浓度分别增加141% (图3-a)、83% (图3-b)、295% (图 3-c)和12% (图3-d), 均达显著水平。说明籽粒胚不 同位置的元素浓度亦存在较大差异。 2.3 胚乳不同位置的元素浓度 胚乳是小麦籽粒最主要的部位, 一般占籽粒总 重的 82.5%。为了解胚乳不同位置元素浓度的空间 分布, 进一步测定了腹沟维管组织一侧从外到内的 3个部位,即糊粉层、外周胚乳(靠近糊粉层)和内侧胚 乳(图 4)。与图 3结果一致, 糊粉层各元素的浓度均 大于胚乳中对应元素的浓度(表 1)。另外, 从胚乳不 同位置看, 外周胚乳的元素浓度大于内侧胚乳对应 元素的浓度, P、Mn、Cu和Zn分别增加5%、22%、 192%和176%, 除P外, 差异均达显著水平(表1)。 n和13C的信号强度(a)与元素与13C的信号比(b) tio of element to 13C (b) of the standard measured by LA-LCP-MS第3期 王云霞等: 用激光剥蚀电感耦合等离 图2 小麦种子横切面(a)及LA-ICP-MS测 Fig. 2 Cross section of wheat seed (a) and the localization of aleurone l al: 糊粉层;

图6-b, c, d)。与金属元素不 同, 非金属元素 P 在腹沟维管组织的浓度很低, 与 胚乳部位几乎没有差异(图5-c, 图6-a)。比较元素的 连续分布可清楚地发现, 籽粒不同部位各元素(P、 Mn、Cu和Zn)浓度的动态变化表现出明显的同步性: 某一元素浓度高的部位其他元素的浓度亦高(图5和 图 6), 说明本试验所测元素在籽粒中存在明显的共 分布特征。 3 讨论 近年来, LA-ICP-MS 测定植物籽粒中元素含量 和分布已有几例报道。Meharg等[18]利用LA-ICP-MS 对糙米中 As 的分析表明, As 主要分布于糙米外层, 学 报 第38卷 MS测定的糊粉层及胚乳不同位置(b) e layer and endosperm at different positions from the aleurone layer (b) 粒外周胚乳;

图 1-b 为扣除各元素信号强度背景值后计算出的 P、 Mn、Cu 和 Zn 与 13C 的比值。13C 作为内标以消除 质谱随时间的信号强度变化和剥蚀量的差异。根据 校正标准样元素浓度和元素与 13C 的信号强度比值, 得到各元素浓度和对应元素与 13C 信号强度比值的 函数关系, y =0.75x+0.0031, R2=1.0000; y =51.445x+ P Mn 7.1219, R2=0.9996; y =121.87x+0.3701, R2=0.9999; Cu y =559.05x−2.5931, R2=1.0000。其中y为元素浓度, Zn x为对应元素与13C信号强度比值。根据这一关系以 及样品中元素与 13C 的信号强度比值可推算样品的 元素浓度。 2.2 籽粒不同部位的元素浓度 将样品放入剥蚀池后, 首先用系统高分辨率成 像光学系统对样品表面形貌进行图像采集(图 2-a), 然后即可方便地在图片上选择测定部位。图 2 为小 麦籽粒各部位的软件主窗口屏幕截图, 分别代表籽 粒横切面(图2-a)、糊粉层和胚乳(图2-b)、胚(图2-c) 图1 LA-ICP-MS标准样品中P、Mn、Cu、Zn Fig. 1 Signal intensities of P, Mn, Cu, Zn, and 13C (a) and the rat 学 报 第38卷 和盾片(图2-d)。激光沿着操作者指定部位(长度300~ 500 µm、宽度50 µm的直线, 图1中黄线所围区域 所示, 下同)自动进行剥蚀取样, 剥蚀样品通过氩气 传输到 ICP-MS, 经分析后给出各元素的信号值 (CPS, counts per second)。 用 LA-ICP-MS 测定小麦籽粒糊粉层、胚(盾片) 和胚乳(图2)的锌浓度(图3), 其中每一样品数值为 300~500 µm 扫描路径上的 46~78 个连续测定值的 均值, 即每6.45 µm获得一个数据。由图3可知, P、 Mn、Cu 和 Zn 的浓度在糊粉层分别为 16.4、80.9、 25.8和347.4 mg kg1, 胚中分别为8.4、150.1、7.9 和195.8 mg kg1, 而胚乳中分别为0.6、8.7、2.1和 8.4 mg kg1。可见小麦成熟种子中元素的空间分布很 不均匀, 主要分布在胚(Mn)或胚乳四周的糊粉层(P、 Cu和Zn), 而胚乳中的浓度很低。P、Mn、Cu和Zn 最高和最低浓度分别相差33、9、15和42倍。 盾片是籽粒胚外侧连接胚乳的组织(图2-a, d)。 盾片部位 P、Mn、Cu和 Zn浓度比胚轴对应元素的 浓度分别增加141% (图3-a)、83% (图3-b)、295% (图 3-c)和12% (图3-d), 均达显著水平。说明籽粒胚不 同位置的元素浓度亦存在较大差异。 2.3 胚乳不同位置的元素浓度 胚乳是小麦籽粒最主要的部位, 一般占籽粒总 重的 82.5%。为了解胚乳不同位置元素浓度的空间 分布, 进一步测定了腹沟维管组织一侧从外到内的 3个部位,即糊粉层、外周胚乳(靠近糊粉层)和内侧胚 乳(图 4)。与图 3结果一致, 糊粉层各元素的浓度均 大于胚乳中对应元素的浓度(表 1)。另外, 从胚乳不 同位置看, 外周胚乳的元素浓度大于内侧胚乳对应 元素的浓度, P、Mn、Cu和Zn分别增加5%、22%、 192%和176%, 除P外, 差异均达显著水平(表1)。 n和13C的信号强度(a)与元素与13C的信号比(b) tio of element to 13C (b) of the standard measured by LA-LCP-MS第3期 王云霞等: 用激光剥蚀电感耦合等离 图2 小麦种子横切面(a)及LA-ICP-MS测 Fig. 2 Cross section of wheat seed (a) and the localization of aleurone l al: 糊粉层;

图6-b, c, d)。与金属元素不 同, 非金属元素 P 在腹沟维管组织的浓度很低, 与 胚乳部位几乎没有差异(图5-c, 图6-a)。比较元素的 连续分布可清楚地发现, 籽粒不同部位各元素(P、 Mn、Cu和Zn)浓度的动态变化表现出明显的同步性: 某一元素浓度高的部位其他元素的浓度亦高(图5和 图 6), 说明本试验所测元素在籽粒中存在明显的共 分布特征。 3 讨论 近年来, LA-ICP-MS 测定植物籽粒中元素含量 和分布已有几例报道。Meharg等[18]利用LA-ICP-MS 对糙米中 As 的分析表明, As 主要分布于糙米外层, 学 报 第38卷 MS测定的糊粉层及胚乳不同位置(b) e layer and endosperm at different positions from the aleurone layer (b) 粒外周胚乳;

Arnhem, Netherlands)制作横切片, 用 双面胶(Tesa AG, Hamburg, Germany)将其固定在载 玻片上, 风干24 h后上机分析。 1.2.2 校正标准样品制作 将 10 g 小麦面粉与 10 mL不同浓度的混合元素标准液(由1 000 mg L−1 ICP SPEX标准液稀释而成)混合, 60℃下烘干48 h, 用振动磨粉机(Puverisette, Fritsch GmbH, Idar- Oberstein, Germany)充分混匀, 取50 mg在真空压片 机上以2 000 kg的压力加压5 min压成直径为5 mm 的薄片标准样。将小麦种子横切片和标准样品同时 置激光剥蚀池内(Supercell, New Wave Research, Fremont, CA, USA), 在同一实验条件下测定。 1.2.3 LA-ICP-MS 工作参数 UP193 激光系统 (UP193 Solid State Laser, UP193 SS)基于193 nm准 分子激光器的激光剥蚀平台控制样品的剥蚀进度, 具有极高的精确度和机械稳定性。将激光侵蚀的样 品通过氩气传输到ICP-MS中进行测定。ICP-MS型 号为7500 cx (Agilent Technology, Santa Clara, CA, USA); 载气流量 Ar 0.25 L min−1; 辅助气流量 Ar 1.25 L min−1; 反映模式Off; RF (radio frequency)功 率1300 W; 激光剥蚀系统为UP193SS, 193 nm (New Wave Research, Fremont, CA, USA); 激光脉冲10 Hz; 扫描(取样)直径50 µm; 扫描速度20 µm s−1; 样品表 面能量密度2 J cm−2。测定元素为P、Cu、Zn、Cd516 作 物 和13C, 其中13C作为内标来标准化激光剥蚀进样量。 1.2.4 用 ICP-MS 测定小麦种子和标准样的元素浓 度 称取标准样或磨样后的小麦种子样品 0.1 g, 在马弗炉 480℃干消化 16 h, 灰化后溶解在 1 mL 1∶3 (HNO ∶H O)的超纯HNO 中, 用9 mL去离子 3 2 3 水稀释后过滤, 然后用 ICP-MS 测定滤液中各种元 素的浓度, 计算籽粒样品中各元素浓度。每个样品4 次重复。 2 结果与分析 2.1 自制标准样的元素浓度 UP193 激光剥蚀系统随机软件使所有取样和测 定过程均可通过电脑操作。图 1-a 显示标准样中已 知浓度的各元素信号强度, 包括P、Mn、Cu和Zn; 图 1-b 为扣除各元素信号强度背景值后计算出的 P、 Mn、Cu 和 Zn 与 13C 的比值。13C 作为内标以消除 质谱随时间的信号强度变化和剥蚀量的差异。根据 校正标准样元素浓度和元素与 13C 的信号强度比值, 得到各元素浓度和对应元素与 13C 信号强度比值的 函数关系, y =0.75x+0.0031, R2=1.0000; y =51.445x+ P Mn 7.1219, R2=0.9996; y =121.87x+0.3701, R2=0.9999; Cu y =559.05x−2.5931, R2=1.0000。其中y为元素浓度, Zn x为对应元素与13C信号强度比值。根据这一关系以 及样品中元素与 13C 的信号强度比值可推算样品的 元素浓度。 2.2 籽粒不同部位的元素浓度 将样品放入剥蚀池后, 首先用系统高分辨率成 像光学系统对样品表面形貌进行图像采集(图 2-a), 然后即可方便地在图片上选择测定部位。图 2 为小 麦籽粒各部位的软件主窗口屏幕截图, 分别代表籽 粒横切面(图2-a)、糊粉层和胚乳(图2-b)、胚(图2-c) 图1 LA-ICP-MS标准样品中P、Mn、Cu、Zn Fig. 1 Signal intensities of P, Mn, Cu, Zn, and 13C (a) and the rat 学 报 第38卷 和盾片(图2-d)。激光沿着操作者指定部位(长度300~ 500 µm、宽度50 µm的直线, 图1中黄线所围区域 所示, 下同)自动进行剥蚀取样, 剥蚀样品通过氩气 传输到 ICP-MS, 经分析后给出各元素的信号值 (CPS, counts per second)。 用 LA-ICP-MS 测定小麦籽粒糊粉层、胚(盾片) 和胚乳(图2)的锌浓度(图3), 其中每一样品数值为 300~500 µm 扫描路径上的 46~78 个连续测定值的 均值, 即每6.45 µm获得一个数据。由图3可知, P、 Mn、Cu 和 Zn 的浓度在糊粉层分别为 16.4、80.9、 25.8和347.4 mg kg1, 胚中分别为8.4、150.1、7.9 和195.8 mg kg1, 而胚乳中分别为0.6、8.7、2.1和 8.4 mg kg1。可见小麦成熟种子中元素的空间分布很 不均匀, 主要分布在胚(Mn)或胚乳四周的糊粉层(P、 Cu和Zn), 而胚乳中的浓度很低。P、Mn、Cu和Zn 最高和最低浓度分别相差33、9、15和42倍。 盾片是籽粒胚外侧连接胚乳的组织(图2-a, d)。 盾片部位 P、Mn、Cu和 Zn浓度比胚轴对应元素的 浓度分别增加141% (图3-a)、83% (图3-b)、295% (图 3-c)和12% (图3-d), 均达显著水平。说明籽粒胚不 同位置的元素浓度亦存在较大差异。 2.3 胚乳不同位置的元素浓度 胚乳是小麦籽粒最主要的部位, 一般占籽粒总 重的 82.5%。为了解胚乳不同位置元素浓度的空间 分布, 进一步测定了腹沟维管组织一侧从外到内的 3个部位,即糊粉层、外周胚乳(靠近糊粉层)和内侧胚 乳(图 4)。与图 3结果一致, 糊粉层各元素的浓度均 大于胚乳中对应元素的浓度(表 1)。另外, 从胚乳不 同位置看, 外周胚乳的元素浓度大于内侧胚乳对应 元素的浓度, P、Mn、Cu和Zn分别增加5%、22%、 192%和176%, 除P外, 差异均达显著水平(表1)。 n和13C的信号强度(a)与元素与13C的信号比(b) tio of element to 13C (b) of the standard measured by LA-LCP-MS第3期 王云霞等: 用激光剥蚀电感耦合等离 图2 小麦种子横切面(a)及LA-ICP-MS测 Fig. 2 Cross section of wheat seed (a) and the localization of aleurone l al: 糊粉层;

图6-b, c, d)。与金属元素不 同, 非金属元素 P 在腹沟维管组织的浓度很低, 与 胚乳部位几乎没有差异(图5-c, 图6-a)。比较元素的 连续分布可清楚地发现, 籽粒不同部位各元素(P、 Mn、Cu和Zn)浓度的动态变化表现出明显的同步性: 某一元素浓度高的部位其他元素的浓度亦高(图5和 图 6), 说明本试验所测元素在籽粒中存在明显的共 分布特征。 3 讨论 近年来, LA-ICP-MS 测定植物籽粒中元素含量 和分布已有几例报道。Meharg等[18]利用LA-ICP-MS 对糙米中 As 的分析表明, As 主要分布于糙米外层, 学 报 第38卷 MS测定的糊粉层及胚乳不同位置(b) e layer and endosperm at different positions from the aleurone layer (b) 粒外周胚乳;

载气流量 Ar 0.25 L min−1; 辅助气流量 Ar 1.25 L min−1; 反映模式Off; RF (radio frequency)功 率1300 W; 激光剥蚀系统为UP193SS, 193 nm (New Wave Research, Fremont, CA, USA); 激光脉冲10 Hz; 扫描(取样)直径50 µm; 扫描速度20 µm s−1; 样品表 面能量密度2 J cm−2。测定元素为P、Cu、Zn、Cd516 作 物 和13C, 其中13C作为内标来标准化激光剥蚀进样量。 1.2.4 用 ICP-MS 测定小麦种子和标准样的元素浓 度 称取标准样或磨样后的小麦种子样品 0.1 g, 在马弗炉 480℃干消化 16 h, 灰化后溶解在 1 mL 1∶3 (HNO ∶H O)的超纯HNO 中, 用9 mL去离子 3 2 3 水稀释后过滤, 然后用 ICP-MS 测定滤液中各种元 素的浓度, 计算籽粒样品中各元素浓度。每个样品4 次重复。 2 结果与分析 2.1 自制标准样的元素浓度 UP193 激光剥蚀系统随机软件使所有取样和测 定过程均可通过电脑操作。图 1-a 显示标准样中已 知浓度的各元素信号强度, 包括P、Mn、Cu和Zn; 图 1-b 为扣除各元素信号强度背景值后计算出的 P、 Mn、Cu 和 Zn 与 13C 的比值。13C 作为内标以消除 质谱随时间的信号强度变化和剥蚀量的差异。根据 校正标准样元素浓度和元素与 13C 的信号强度比值, 得到各元素浓度和对应元素与 13C 信号强度比值的 函数关系, y =0.75x+0.0031, R2=1.0000; y =51.445x+ P Mn 7.1219, R2=0.9996; y =121.87x+0.3701, R2=0.9999; Cu y =559.05x−2.5931, R2=1.0000。其中y为元素浓度, Zn x为对应元素与13C信号强度比值。根据这一关系以 及样品中元素与 13C 的信号强度比值可推算样品的 元素浓度。 2.2 籽粒不同部位的元素浓度 将样品放入剥蚀池后, 首先用系统高分辨率成 像光学系统对样品表面形貌进行图像采集(图 2-a), 然后即可方便地在图片上选择测定部位。图 2 为小 麦籽粒各部位的软件主窗口屏幕截图, 分别代表籽 粒横切面(图2-a)、糊粉层和胚乳(图2-b)、胚(图2-c) 图1 LA-ICP-MS标准样品中P、Mn、Cu、Zn Fig. 1 Signal intensities of P, Mn, Cu, Zn, and 13C (a) and the rat 学 报 第38卷 和盾片(图2-d)。激光沿着操作者指定部位(长度300~ 500 µm、宽度50 µm的直线, 图1中黄线所围区域 所示, 下同)自动进行剥蚀取样, 剥蚀样品通过氩气 传输到 ICP-MS, 经分析后给出各元素的信号值 (CPS, counts per second)。 用 LA-ICP-MS 测定小麦籽粒糊粉层、胚(盾片) 和胚乳(图2)的锌浓度(图3), 其中每一样品数值为 300~500 µm 扫描路径上的 46~78 个连续测定值的 均值, 即每6.45 µm获得一个数据。由图3可知, P、 Mn、Cu 和 Zn 的浓度在糊粉层分别为 16.4、80.9、 25.8和347.4 mg kg1, 胚中分别为8.4、150.1、7.9 和195.8 mg kg1, 而胚乳中分别为0.6、8.7、2.1和 8.4 mg kg1。可见小麦成熟种子中元素的空间分布很 不均匀, 主要分布在胚(Mn)或胚乳四周的糊粉层(P、 Cu和Zn), 而胚乳中的浓度很低。P、Mn、Cu和Zn 最高和最低浓度分别相差33、9、15和42倍。 盾片是籽粒胚外侧连接胚乳的组织(图2-a, d)。 盾片部位 P、Mn、Cu和 Zn浓度比胚轴对应元素的 浓度分别增加141% (图3-a)、83% (图3-b)、295% (图 3-c)和12% (图3-d), 均达显著水平。说明籽粒胚不 同位置的元素浓度亦存在较大差异。 2.3 胚乳不同位置的元素浓度 胚乳是小麦籽粒最主要的部位, 一般占籽粒总 重的 82.5%。为了解胚乳不同位置元素浓度的空间 分布, 进一步测定了腹沟维管组织一侧从外到内的 3个部位,即糊粉层、外周胚乳(靠近糊粉层)和内侧胚 乳(图 4)。与图 3结果一致, 糊粉层各元素的浓度均 大于胚乳中对应元素的浓度(表 1)。另外, 从胚乳不 同位置看, 外周胚乳的元素浓度大于内侧胚乳对应 元素的浓度, P、Mn、Cu和Zn分别增加5%、22%、 192%和176%, 除P外, 差异均达显著水平(表1)。 n和13C的信号强度(a)与元素与13C的信号比(b) tio of element to 13C (b) of the standard measured by LA-LCP-MS第3期 王云霞等: 用激光剥蚀电感耦合等离 图2 小麦种子横切面(a)及LA-ICP-MS测 Fig. 2 Cross section of wheat seed (a) and the localization of aleurone l al: 糊粉层;

图6-b, c, d)。与金属元素不 同, 非金属元素 P 在腹沟维管组织的浓度很低, 与 胚乳部位几乎没有差异(图5-c, 图6-a)。比较元素的 连续分布可清楚地发现, 籽粒不同部位各元素(P、 Mn、Cu和Zn)浓度的动态变化表现出明显的同步性: 某一元素浓度高的部位其他元素的浓度亦高(图5和 图 6), 说明本试验所测元素在籽粒中存在明显的共 分布特征。 3 讨论 近年来, LA-ICP-MS 测定植物籽粒中元素含量 和分布已有几例报道。Meharg等[18]利用LA-ICP-MS 对糙米中 As 的分析表明, As 主要分布于糙米外层, 学 报 第38卷 MS测定的糊粉层及胚乳不同位置(b) e layer and endosperm at different positions from the aleurone layer (b) 粒外周胚乳;

载气流量 Ar 0.25 L min−1; 辅助气流量 Ar 1.25 L min−1; 反映模式Off; RF (radio frequency)功 率1300 W; 激光剥蚀系统为UP193SS, 193 nm (New Wave Research, Fremont, CA, USA); 激光脉冲10 Hz; 扫描(取样)直径50 µm; 扫描速度20 µm s−1; 样品表 面能量密度2 J cm−2。测定元素为P、Cu、Zn、Cd516 作 物 和13C, 其中13C作为内标来标准化激光剥蚀进样量。 1.2.4 用 ICP-MS 测定小麦种子和标准样的元素浓 度 称取标准样或磨样后的小麦种子样品 0.1 g, 在马弗炉 480℃干消化 16 h, 灰化后溶解在 1 mL 1∶3 (HNO ∶H O)的超纯HNO 中, 用9 mL去离子 3 2 3 水稀释后过滤, 然后用 ICP-MS 测定滤液中各种元 素的浓度, 计算籽粒样品中各元素浓度。每个样品4 次重复。 2 结果与分析 2.1 自制标准样的元素浓度 UP193 激光剥蚀系统随机软件使所有取样和测 定过程均可通过电脑操作。图 1-a 显示标准样中已 知浓度的各元素信号强度, 包括P、Mn、Cu和Zn; 图 1-b 为扣除各元素信号强度背景值后计算出的 P、 Mn、Cu 和 Zn 与 13C 的比值。13C 作为内标以消除 质谱随时间的信号强度变化和剥蚀量的差异。根据 校正标准样元素浓度和元素与 13C 的信号强度比值, 得到各元素浓度和对应元素与 13C 信号强度比值的 函数关系, y =0.75x+0.0031, R2=1.0000; y =51.445x+ P Mn 7.1219, R2=0.9996; y =121.87x+0.3701, R2=0.9999; Cu y =559.05x−2.5931, R2=1.0000。其中y为元素浓度, Zn x为对应元素与13C信号强度比值。根据这一关系以 及样品中元素与 13C 的信号强度比值可推算样品的 元素浓度。 2.2 籽粒不同部位的元素浓度 将样品放入剥蚀池后, 首先用系统高分辨率成 像光学系统对样品表面形貌进行图像采集(图 2-a), 然后即可方便地在图片上选择测定部位。图 2 为小 麦籽粒各部位的软件主窗口屏幕截图, 分别代表籽 粒横切面(图2-a)、糊粉层和胚乳(图2-b)、胚(图2-c) 图1 LA-ICP-MS标准样品中P、Mn、Cu、Zn Fig. 1 Signal intensities of P, Mn, Cu, Zn, and 13C (a) and the rat 学 报 第38卷 和盾片(图2-d)。激光沿着操作者指定部位(长度300~ 500 µm、宽度50 µm的直线, 图1中黄线所围区域 所示, 下同)自动进行剥蚀取样, 剥蚀样品通过氩气 传输到 ICP-MS, 经分析后给出各元素的信号值 (CPS, counts per second)。 用 LA-ICP-MS 测定小麦籽粒糊粉层、胚(盾片) 和胚乳(图2)的锌浓度(图3), 其中每一样品数值为 300~500 µm 扫描路径上的 46~78 个连续测定值的 均值, 即每6.45 µm获得一个数据。由图3可知, P、 Mn、Cu 和 Zn 的浓度在糊粉层分别为 16.4、80.9、 25.8和347.4 mg kg1, 胚中分别为8.4、150.1、7.9 和195.8 mg kg1, 而胚乳中分别为0.6、8.7、2.1和 8.4 mg kg1。可见小麦成熟种子中元素的空间分布很 不均匀, 主要分布在胚(Mn)或胚乳四周的糊粉层(P、 Cu和Zn), 而胚乳中的浓度很低。P、Mn、Cu和Zn 最高和最低浓度分别相差33、9、15和42倍。 盾片是籽粒胚外侧连接胚乳的组织(图2-a, d)。 盾片部位 P、Mn、Cu和 Zn浓度比胚轴对应元素的 浓度分别增加141% (图3-a)、83% (图3-b)、295% (图 3-c)和12% (图3-d), 均达显著水平。说明籽粒胚不 同位置的元素浓度亦存在较大差异。 2.3 胚乳不同位置的元素浓度 胚乳是小麦籽粒最主要的部位, 一般占籽粒总 重的 82.5%。为了解胚乳不同位置元素浓度的空间 分布, 进一步测定了腹沟维管组织一侧从外到内的 3个部位,即糊粉层、外周胚乳(靠近糊粉层)和内侧胚 乳(图 4)。与图 3结果一致, 糊粉层各元素的浓度均 大于胚乳中对应元素的浓度(表 1)。另外, 从胚乳不 同位置看, 外周胚乳的元素浓度大于内侧胚乳对应 元素的浓度, P、Mn、Cu和Zn分别增加5%、22%、 192%和176%, 除P外, 差异均达显著水平(表1)。 n和13C的信号强度(a)与元素与13C的信号比(b) tio of element to 13C (b) of the standard measured by LA-LCP-MS第3期 王云霞等: 用激光剥蚀电感耦合等离 图2 小麦种子横切面(a)及LA-ICP-MS测 Fig. 2 Cross section of wheat seed (a) and the localization of aleurone l al: 糊粉层;

图6-b, c, d)。与金属元素不 同, 非金属元素 P 在腹沟维管组织的浓度很低, 与 胚乳部位几乎没有差异(图5-c, 图6-a)。比较元素的 连续分布可清楚地发现, 籽粒不同部位各元素(P、 Mn、Cu和Zn)浓度的动态变化表现出明显的同步性: 某一元素浓度高的部位其他元素的浓度亦高(图5和 图 6), 说明本试验所测元素在籽粒中存在明显的共 分布特征。 3 讨论 近年来, LA-ICP-MS 测定植物籽粒中元素含量 和分布已有几例报道。Meharg等[18]利用LA-ICP-MS 对糙米中 As 的分析表明, As 主要分布于糙米外层, 学 报 第38卷 MS测定的糊粉层及胚乳不同位置(b) e layer and endosperm at different positions from the aleurone layer (b) 粒外周胚乳;

载气流量 Ar 0.25 L min−1; 辅助气流量 Ar 1.25 L min−1; 反映模式Off; RF (radio frequency)功 率1300 W; 激光剥蚀系统为UP193SS, 193 nm (New Wave Research, Fremont, CA, USA); 激光脉冲10 Hz; 扫描(取样)直径50 µm; 扫描速度20 µm s−1; 样品表 面能量密度2 J cm−2。测定元素为P、Cu、Zn、Cd516 作 物 和13C, 其中13C作为内标来标准化激光剥蚀进样量。 1.2.4 用 ICP-MS 测定小麦种子和标准样的元素浓 度 称取标准样或磨样后的小麦种子样品 0.1 g, 在马弗炉 480℃干消化 16 h, 灰化后溶解在 1 mL 1∶3 (HNO ∶H O)的超纯HNO 中, 用9 mL去离子 3 2 3 水稀释后过滤, 然后用 ICP-MS 测定滤液中各种元 素的浓度, 计算籽粒样品中各元素浓度。每个样品4 次重复。 2 结果与分析 2.1 自制标准样的元素浓度 UP193 激光剥蚀系统随机软件使所有取样和测 定过程均可通过电脑操作。图 1-a 显示标准样中已 知浓度的各元素信号强度, 包括P、Mn、Cu和Zn; 图 1-b 为扣除各元素信号强度背景值后计算出的 P、 Mn、Cu 和 Zn 与 13C 的比值。13C 作为内标以消除 质谱随时间的信号强度变化和剥蚀量的差异。根据 校正标准样元素浓度和元素与 13C 的信号强度比值, 得到各元素浓度和对应元素与 13C 信号强度比值的 函数关系, y =0.75x+0.0031, R2=1.0000; y =51.445x+ P Mn 7.1219, R2=0.9996; y =121.87x+0.3701, R2=0.9999; Cu y =559.05x−2.5931, R2=1.0000。其中y为元素浓度, Zn x为对应元素与13C信号强度比值。根据这一关系以 及样品中元素与 13C 的信号强度比值可推算样品的 元素浓度。 2.2 籽粒不同部位的元素浓度 将样品放入剥蚀池后, 首先用系统高分辨率成 像光学系统对样品表面形貌进行图像采集(图 2-a), 然后即可方便地在图片上选择测定部位。图 2 为小 麦籽粒各部位的软件主窗口屏幕截图, 分别代表籽 粒横切面(图2-a)、糊粉层和胚乳(图2-b)、胚(图2-c) 图1 LA-ICP-MS标准样品中P、Mn、Cu、Zn Fig. 1 Signal intensities of P, Mn, Cu, Zn, and 13C (a) and the rat 学 报 第38卷 和盾片(图2-d)。激光沿着操作者指定部位(长度300~ 500 µm、宽度50 µm的直线, 图1中黄线所围区域 所示, 下同)自动进行剥蚀取样, 剥蚀样品通过氩气 传输到 ICP-MS, 经分析后给出各元素的信号值 (CPS, counts per second)。 用 LA-ICP-MS 测定小麦籽粒糊粉层、胚(盾片) 和胚乳(图2)的锌浓度(图3), 其中每一样品数值为 300~500 µm 扫描路径上的 46~78 个连续测定值的 均值, 即每6.45 µm获得一个数据。由图3可知, P、 Mn、Cu 和 Zn 的浓度在糊粉层分别为 16.4、80.9、 25.8和347.4 mg kg1, 胚中分别为8.4、150.1、7.9 和195.8 mg kg1, 而胚乳中分别为0.6、8.7、2.1和 8.4 mg kg1。可见小麦成熟种子中元素的空间分布很 不均匀, 主要分布在胚(Mn)或胚乳四周的糊粉层(P、 Cu和Zn), 而胚乳中的浓度很低。P、Mn、Cu和Zn 最高和最低浓度分别相差33、9、15和42倍。 盾片是籽粒胚外侧连接胚乳的组织(图2-a, d)。 盾片部位 P、Mn、Cu和 Zn浓度比胚轴对应元素的 浓度分别增加141% (图3-a)、83% (图3-b)、295% (图 3-c)和12% (图3-d), 均达显著水平。说明籽粒胚不 同位置的元素浓度亦存在较大差异。 2.3 胚乳不同位置的元素浓度 胚乳是小麦籽粒最主要的部位, 一般占籽粒总 重的 82.5%。为了解胚乳不同位置元素浓度的空间 分布, 进一步测定了腹沟维管组织一侧从外到内的 3个部位,即糊粉层、外周胚乳(靠近糊粉层)和内侧胚 乳(图 4)。与图 3结果一致, 糊粉层各元素的浓度均 大于胚乳中对应元素的浓度(表 1)。另外, 从胚乳不 同位置看, 外周胚乳的元素浓度大于内侧胚乳对应 元素的浓度, P、Mn、Cu和Zn分别增加5%、22%、 192%和176%, 除P外, 差异均达显著水平(表1)。 n和13C的信号强度(a)与元素与13C的信号比(b) tio of element to 13C (b) of the standard measured by LA-LCP-MS第3期 王云霞等: 用激光剥蚀电感耦合等离 图2 小麦种子横切面(a)及LA-ICP-MS测 Fig. 2 Cross section of wheat seed (a) and the localization of aleurone l al: 糊粉层;

图6-b, c, d)。与金属元素不 同, 非金属元素 P 在腹沟维管组织的浓度很低, 与 胚乳部位几乎没有差异(图5-c, 图6-a)。比较元素的 连续分布可清楚地发现, 籽粒不同部位各元素(P、 Mn、Cu和Zn)浓度的动态变化表现出明显的同步性: 某一元素浓度高的部位其他元素的浓度亦高(图5和 图 6), 说明本试验所测元素在籽粒中存在明显的共 分布特征。 3 讨论 近年来, LA-ICP-MS 测定植物籽粒中元素含量 和分布已有几例报道。Meharg等[18]利用LA-ICP-MS 对糙米中 As 的分析表明, As 主要分布于糙米外层, 学 报 第38卷 MS测定的糊粉层及胚乳不同位置(b) e layer and endosperm at different positions from the aleurone layer (b) 粒外周胚乳;

载气流量 Ar 0.25 L min−1; 辅助气流量 Ar 1.25 L min−1; 反映模式Off; RF (radio frequency)功 率1300 W; 激光剥蚀系统为UP193SS, 193 nm (New Wave Research, Fremont, CA, USA); 激光脉冲10 Hz; 扫描(取样)直径50 µm; 扫描速度20 µm s−1; 样品表 面能量密度2 J cm−2。测定元素为P、Cu、Zn、Cd516 作 物 和13C, 其中13C作为内标来标准化激光剥蚀进样量。 1.2.4 用 ICP-MS 测定小麦种子和标准样的元素浓 度 称取标准样或磨样后的小麦种子样品 0.1 g, 在马弗炉 480℃干消化 16 h, 灰化后溶解在 1 mL 1∶3 (HNO ∶H O)的超纯HNO 中, 用9 mL去离子 3 2 3 水稀释后过滤, 然后用 ICP-MS 测定滤液中各种元 素的浓度, 计算籽粒样品中各元素浓度。每个样品4 次重复。 2 结果与分析 2.1 自制标准样的元素浓度 UP193 激光剥蚀系统随机软件使所有取样和测 定过程均可通过电脑操作。图 1-a 显示标准样中已 知浓度的各元素信号强度, 包括P、Mn、Cu和Zn; 图 1-b 为扣除各元素信号强度背景值后计算出的 P、 Mn、Cu 和 Zn 与 13C 的比值。13C 作为内标以消除 质谱随时间的信号强度变化和剥蚀量的差异。根据 校正标准样元素浓度和元素与 13C 的信号强度比值, 得到各元素浓度和对应元素与 13C 信号强度比值的 函数关系, y =0.75x+0.0031, R2=1.0000; y =51.445x+ P Mn 7.1219, R2=0.9996; y =121.87x+0.3701, R2=0.9999; Cu y =559.05x−2.5931, R2=1.0000。其中y为元素浓度, Zn x为对应元素与13C信号强度比值。根据这一关系以 及样品中元素与 13C 的信号强度比值可推算样品的 元素浓度。 2.2 籽粒不同部位的元素浓度 将样品放入剥蚀池后, 首先用系统高分辨率成 像光学系统对样品表面形貌进行图像采集(图 2-a), 然后即可方便地在图片上选择测定部位。图 2 为小 麦籽粒各部位的软件主窗口屏幕截图, 分别代表籽 粒横切面(图2-a)、糊粉层和胚乳(图2-b)、胚(图2-c) 图1 LA-ICP-MS标准样品中P、Mn、Cu、Zn Fig. 1 Signal intensities of P, Mn, Cu, Zn, and 13C (a) and the rat 学 报 第38卷 和盾片(图2-d)。激光沿着操作者指定部位(长度300~ 500 µm、宽度50 µm的直线, 图1中黄线所围区域 所示, 下同)自动进行剥蚀取样, 剥蚀样品通过氩气 传输到 ICP-MS, 经分析后给出各元素的信号值 (CPS, counts per second)。 用 LA-ICP-MS 测定小麦籽粒糊粉层、胚(盾片) 和胚乳(图2)的锌浓度(图3), 其中每一样品数值为 300~500 µm 扫描路径上的 46~78 个连续测定值的 均值, 即每6.45 µm获得一个数据。由图3可知, P、 Mn、Cu 和 Zn 的浓度在糊粉层分别为 16.4、80.9、 25.8和347.4 mg kg1, 胚中分别为8.4、150.1、7.9 和195.8 mg kg1, 而胚乳中分别为0.6、8.7、2.1和 8.4 mg kg1。可见小麦成熟种子中元素的空间分布很 不均匀, 主要分布在胚(Mn)或胚乳四周的糊粉层(P、 Cu和Zn), 而胚乳中的浓度很低。P、Mn、Cu和Zn 最高和最低浓度分别相差33、9、15和42倍。 盾片是籽粒胚外侧连接胚乳的组织(图2-a, d)。 盾片部位 P、Mn、Cu和 Zn浓度比胚轴对应元素的 浓度分别增加141% (图3-a)、83% (图3-b)、295% (图 3-c)和12% (图3-d), 均达显著水平。说明籽粒胚不 同位置的元素浓度亦存在较大差异。 2.3 胚乳不同位置的元素浓度 胚乳是小麦籽粒最主要的部位, 一般占籽粒总 重的 82.5%。为了解胚乳不同位置元素浓度的空间 分布, 进一步测定了腹沟维管组织一侧从外到内的 3个部位,即糊粉层、外周胚乳(靠近糊粉层)和内侧胚 乳(图 4)。与图 3结果一致, 糊粉层各元素的浓度均 大于胚乳中对应元素的浓度(表 1)。另外, 从胚乳不 同位置看, 外周胚乳的元素浓度大于内侧胚乳对应 元素的浓度, P、Mn、Cu和Zn分别增加5%、22%、 192%和176%, 除P外, 差异均达显著水平(表1)。 n和13C的信号强度(a)与元素与13C的信号比(b) tio of element to 13C (b) of the standard measured by LA-LCP-MS第3期 王云霞等: 用激光剥蚀电感耦合等离 图2 小麦种子横切面(a)及LA-ICP-MS测 Fig. 2 Cross section of wheat seed (a) and the localization of aleurone l al: 糊粉层;

图6-b, c, d)。与金属元素不 同, 非金属元素 P 在腹沟维管组织的浓度很低, 与 胚乳部位几乎没有差异(图5-c, 图6-a)。比较元素的 连续分布可清楚地发现, 籽粒不同部位各元素(P、 Mn、Cu和Zn)浓度的动态变化表现出明显的同步性: 某一元素浓度高的部位其他元素的浓度亦高(图5和 图 6), 说明本试验所测元素在籽粒中存在明显的共 分布特征。 3 讨论 近年来, LA-ICP-MS 测定植物籽粒中元素含量 和分布已有几例报道。Meharg等[18]利用LA-ICP-MS 对糙米中 As 的分析表明, As 主要分布于糙米外层, 学 报 第38卷 MS测定的糊粉层及胚乳不同位置(b) e layer and endosperm at different positions from the aleurone layer (b) 粒外周胚乳;

Arnhem, Netherlands)制作横切片, 用 双面胶(Tesa AG, Hamburg, Germany)将其固定在载 玻片上, 风干24 h后上机分析。 1.2.2 校正标准样品制作 将 10 g 小麦面粉与 10 mL不同浓度的混合元素标准液(由1 000 mg L−1 ICP SPEX标准液稀释而成)混合, 60℃下烘干48 h, 用振动磨粉机(Puverisette, Fritsch GmbH, Idar- Oberstein, Germany)充分混匀, 取50 mg在真空压片 机上以2 000 kg的压力加压5 min压成直径为5 mm 的薄片标准样。将小麦种子横切片和标准样品同时 置激光剥蚀池内(Supercell, New Wave Research, Fremont, CA, USA), 在同一实验条件下测定。 1.2.3 LA-ICP-MS 工作参数 UP193 激光系统 (UP193 Solid State Laser, UP193 SS)基于193 nm准 分子激光器的激光剥蚀平台控制样品的剥蚀进度, 具有极高的精确度和机械稳定性。将激光侵蚀的样 品通过氩气传输到ICP-MS中进行测定。ICP-MS型 号为7500 cx (Agilent Technology, Santa Clara, CA, USA);

图 1-b 为扣除各元素信号强度背景值后计算出的 P、 Mn、Cu 和 Zn 与 13C 的比值。13C 作为内标以消除 质谱随时间的信号强度变化和剥蚀量的差异。根据 校正标准样元素浓度和元素与 13C 的信号强度比值, 得到各元素浓度和对应元素与 13C 信号强度比值的 函数关系, y =0.75x+0.0031, R2=1.0000; y =51.445x+ P Mn 7.1219, R2=0.9996; y =121.87x+0.3701, R2=0.9999; Cu y =559.05x−2.5931, R2=1.0000。其中y为元素浓度, Zn x为对应元素与13C信号强度比值。根据这一关系以 及样品中元素与 13C 的信号强度比值可推算样品的 元素浓度。 2.2 籽粒不同部位的元素浓度 将样品放入剥蚀池后, 首先用系统高分辨率成 像光学系统对样品表面形貌进行图像采集(图 2-a), 然后即可方便地在图片上选择测定部位。图 2 为小 麦籽粒各部位的软件主窗口屏幕截图, 分别代表籽 粒横切面(图2-a)、糊粉层和胚乳(图2-b)、胚(图2-c) 图1 LA-ICP-MS标准样品中P、Mn、Cu、Zn Fig. 1 Signal intensities of P, Mn, Cu, Zn, and 13C (a) and the rat 学 报 第38卷 和盾片(图2-d)。激光沿着操作者指定部位(长度300~ 500 µm、宽度50 µm的直线, 图1中黄线所围区域 所示, 下同)自动进行剥蚀取样, 剥蚀样品通过氩气 传输到 ICP-MS, 经分析后给出各元素的信号值 (CPS, counts per second)。 用 LA-ICP-MS 测定小麦籽粒糊粉层、胚(盾片) 和胚乳(图2)的锌浓度(图3), 其中每一样品数值为 300~500 µm 扫描路径上的 46~78 个连续测定值的 均值, 即每6.45 µm获得一个数据。由图3可知, P、 Mn、Cu 和 Zn 的浓度在糊粉层分别为 16.4、80.9、 25.8和347.4 mg kg1, 胚中分别为8.4、150.1、7.9 和195.8 mg kg1, 而胚乳中分别为0.6、8.7、2.1和 8.4 mg kg1。可见小麦成熟种子中元素的空间分布很 不均匀, 主要分布在胚(Mn)或胚乳四周的糊粉层(P、 Cu和Zn), 而胚乳中的浓度很低。P、Mn、Cu和Zn 最高和最低浓度分别相差33、9、15和42倍。 盾片是籽粒胚外侧连接胚乳的组织(图2-a, d)。 盾片部位 P、Mn、Cu和 Zn浓度比胚轴对应元素的 浓度分别增加141% (图3-a)、83% (图3-b)、295% (图 3-c)和12% (图3-d), 均达显著水平。说明籽粒胚不 同位置的元素浓度亦存在较大差异。 2.3 胚乳不同位置的元素浓度 胚乳是小麦籽粒最主要的部位, 一般占籽粒总 重的 82.5%。为了解胚乳不同位置元素浓度的空间 分布, 进一步测定了腹沟维管组织一侧从外到内的 3个部位,即糊粉层、外周胚乳(靠近糊粉层)和内侧胚 乳(图 4)。与图 3结果一致, 糊粉层各元素的浓度均 大于胚乳中对应元素的浓度(表 1)。另外, 从胚乳不 同位置看, 外周胚乳的元素浓度大于内侧胚乳对应 元素的浓度, P、Mn、Cu和Zn分别增加5%、22%、 192%和176%, 除P外, 差异均达显著水平(表1)。 n和13C的信号强度(a)与元素与13C的信号比(b) tio of element to 13C (b) of the standard measured by LA-LCP-MS第3期 王云霞等: 用激光剥蚀电感耦合等离 图2 小麦种子横切面(a)及LA-ICP-MS测 Fig. 2 Cross section of wheat seed (a) and the localization of aleurone l al: 糊粉层;

图6-b, c, d)。与金属元素不 同, 非金属元素 P 在腹沟维管组织的浓度很低, 与 胚乳部位几乎没有差异(图5-c, 图6-a)。比较元素的 连续分布可清楚地发现, 籽粒不同部位各元素(P、 Mn、Cu和Zn)浓度的动态变化表现出明显的同步性: 某一元素浓度高的部位其他元素的浓度亦高(图5和 图 6), 说明本试验所测元素在籽粒中存在明显的共 分布特征。 3 讨论 近年来, LA-ICP-MS 测定植物籽粒中元素含量 和分布已有几例报道。Meharg等[18]利用LA-ICP-MS 对糙米中 As 的分析表明, As 主要分布于糙米外层, 学 报 第38卷 MS测定的糊粉层及胚乳不同位置(b) e layer and endosperm at different positions from the aleurone layer (b) 粒外周胚乳;

Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the most potent circulating androgenandissynthesizedfromTbyperipheraltissues,with an affinity for the androgen receptor (AR) two to three times greater than T.(18) DHEA conversion to DHT requires three ste- roidogenic enzymes: 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD),17β-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase(17βHSD),andste- roid 5α-reductase (SRD5α) (Fig. 1).

Significant M androstenediolwasdetectedin22Rv1andARCaP ,andlessin M C4-2B and LNCaP. C4-2B generated significant T followed by 22Rv1, LNCaP, and ARCaP .

ConditionedmediaofosteoblaststreatedwithDHEA activateprostatecancerARsignaling The capacity for osteoblast-generated T to activate AR signaling in prostate cancer cells was next tested. Since the androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells also synthesize JournalofBoneandMineralResearch androgens from DHEA, the contributions of each cell type to generate androgens were determined. Residual T already pre- sent in osteoblast conditioned media(CM) would immediately activateprostatecancerARsignaling,whereasDHEAmustfirst beconvertedtoTorDHTinprostatecancercellsbeforeARsig- nalingwouldcommence. The prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and C4-2B were trans- duced with a lentivirus AR-reporter construct (tat3-GLuc) con- taining three AREs fused to a basal promoter and Gaussia luciferase (GLuc).(31) GLuc is a secreted protein that allows for easy collection of media over time as a measure of androgen receptorsignalingactivation.Thecellswerealsotransducedwith a lentivirus constitutively expressing DsRed, with fluorescence used to normalize GLuc values to relative cell number. The androgenanalogR1881robustlyincreasedGLucactivityinboth LNCaP and C4-2B prostate cancer cell lines (Supplemental Fig.S3).TheabilityofosteoblastCMtoactivateprostatecancer ARsignalingwasnextexamined(Fig.5).CMwascollectedfrom murine long-bone osteoblasts 72hours after treatment with 100nM and 1μM DHEA, or an ethanol vehicle control. More immediateincreasesinGLucwereexpectedfromTalreadypre- sentinDHEA-treatedosteoblastCMcomparedwithdirectDHEA treatmentoftheprostatecancercells.Afterprostatecancercells were transduced with the tat3-Gluc/DsRed lentivirus combina- tion, the media were replaced with 50% of the respective prostate cancer medium and 50% CM from osteoblasts that had been treated with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control. These groups were compared with the pros- tate cancer cells treated directy with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control along with 50% osteoblast CM treated with EtOH. As expected, the groups treated with ethanol vehicle CM or ethanol vehicle directly did not show AR signaling activation (Fig. 6). In both LNCaP and C4-2B cell lines, treatment with 100nM DHEA CM versus 100nM DHEA, and 1μM DHEA CM versus 1μM DHEA resulted in signifi- cantly more AR signaling activation at 12, 24, 36, and 48hours. Continued differences were detected in the LNCaP cell line at 72hours. In the C4-2B cell line, 100nM DHEA treatment at 72hours resulted in even greater AR signaling activation compared with the 100nM DHEA CM group. At 1μM DHEA CM compared with 1μM DHEA treatment, the degree of AR signaling activation was similar. EnzalutamideblocksprostatecancerARsignalinginduced byosteoblast-generatedandrogen Enzalutamide is an effective and specific androgen antagonist thatblocksthreeARactivationsteps:androgenbinding toAR, translocationoftheandrogen-ARcomplexto thenucleus, and the assocation of the androgen-AR complex to AREs.(34) To demonstrate the specificity of DHEA-treated osteoblast CM acting through AR signaling, the ability of enzalutamide to block AR signaling was tested. C4-2B prostate cancer cells were transduced with the tat3-GLuc/DsRed lentivirus combi- nation and treated with and without 1μM enzalutamide daily, as well as 100nM DHEA CM (Fig. 7A), 1μM DHEA CM (Fig. 7B), or ethanol vehicle control. Enzalutamide significantly blocked AR signaling of cells treated with 100nM DHEA CM and 1μM DHEA CM at 48 and 72hours. These data indicate specific AR signaling activation of prostate cancer cells by osteoblast-generated androgens. n OSTEOBLASTSGENERATETESTOSTERONE 1573Fig8.

The intratumoral generation of androgens is an important mechanismofCRPCprogression.(14–17)However,thefrequency anddegreeinwhichthisphenomenonoccurs,especiallyinbone metastasis, are unknown.

As bone metastasis progresses, the contribution of prostate cancer–generated androgenswouldthendependnotonlyoncellnumbersbutalso on the capacity of these prostate cancer cells to generate androgens. Toinvestigatehowosteoblast-generatedandrogenscontrib- utetoprostatecancerARsignalingandgrowth,astrategywas selected in which CM from osteoblasts after DHEA treatment wascomparedwiththedirecttreatmentofDHEA.Sinceosteo- blastsdidnotcompletelymetabolizeallDHEA,andandrostene- diolandandrostenedioneintermediateswerealsopresentinthe CM,thesesubstrateslikelycontributedtotheintratumoralgen- eration of androgens by prostate cancer cells. However, since enzymaticconversionofthesesubstratesbytheprostatecancer cellstakestime,thegreaterincreaseinARsignalingwiththeCM at the earlier time points is due to osteoblast-generated testosterone. Althoughosteoblast-generatedandrogens,asreportedhere, likely contribute to prostate cancer expansion in bone, other mechanisms ofprostatecancerregulationbyosteoblasts have beenreported.Inonereport,co-culturewiththepre-osteoblast cell line MC3T3 accentuated the DHT-regulated increase in MDA-PCa-2bprostatecancercellnumbers.(42)CMfromMC3T3 cellsalsoincreasedtheexpressionofARandthesteroidogenesis enzymes HSD3B1, AKR1C3, and SRD5A1 in the CRPC cell line LNCaP-19, leading to an increase in intratumoral androgen n 1576 MOONETAL. productionandapossibleincreaseinARsensitivity.(43)Further- more, the CM of human primary osteoblast cultures was reported to increase PSA production of LNCaP cells in the absenceofsteroidtreatment.Althoughasimilarresultwasnot foundinthedatapresentedhere,thismaysuggestdifferences betweenhumanandmouseprimaryosteoblastcultures.(44) TheLNCaPandC4-2Bprostatecancercellswereselectedfor further study because of the responsiveness to osteoblast- generatedandrogens.Theywerealsoselectedfortheirdissimi- larities in androgen production. Although LNCaP cells had a comparableabilitytogeneratetestosteroneasosteoblasts,the generationoftestosteronedidnotkeeppacewithtestosterone presentintheosteoblastCM.TheLNCaPprostatecancercellline demonstratedgreaterARsignaling,PSAsecretion,andcellnum- bers with DHEA CM treatments compared with DHEA added directlytotheculturemedia.C4-2Bcells,however,displayeddif- ferentkineticstoosteoblastCM.Atearliertimepointsandwith the100nMCMtreatment,therewasatrendforgreaterARsig- naling, PSA production, and cell growth. However, C4-2B AR signalingactivationatlatertimepointsandatthehigher1μM DHEAdirecttreatmentoutpacedtheandrogenpresentinosteo- blast CM. This was likely because of the robust conversion of DHEA to testosteroneandespecially DHTinthis cell line.Both celllinesdemonstratedarapidincreaseinPSAproductionwith the DHEA CM treatments since PSA is a robust, early indicator of AR activation, as previously reported.(45,46) In contrast, the increaseincellnumberswiththeDHEACMtreatmentsisacon- firmatorybutslowersignofandrogenaction.(47,48) The effects of DHEA and R1881 on AR signaling were also investigated in osteoblasts. Despite osteoblasts generating T fromDHEA,ARsignalingwasnotincreasedcomparedwithvehi- clecontrol.AlthoughtheconcentrationofTwassufficientforAR binding,theabsenceofDHTintheCMofDHEA-treatedosteo- blastswasapossiblecontributor.Osteoblastslacktheexpression ofSrd5a2thatencodesanenzymewithanaffinityforTthatis 14 to 20 times greater than the enzyme encoded by Srdr5a1.(49,50) The kinetics of the enzyme encoded by Srd5a3 areunknown.R1881didincreaseARsignalingmodestlyabove thevehiclecontrol.Thesedataindicatethatthemurineosteo- blasts harvested from the ends of long bones, specifically the epiphysealandmetaphysealregions,arenothighlysensitiveto androgens, despite AR expression. Although osteoblasts have beenreportedtobetargetsofandrogens,(42)thisisnottruewith osteoblastsinallskeletalcompartments.Theskeletalphenotype ofosteoblast-targetedgeneticdeletionofArhasbeenreported by a number of groups.(51–54) The consensus among these reportsisthattrabecularbonebutnotcorticalboneosteoblasts aresensitivetoARactionsinbothsexes.Becauseatleastapartial responsetoR1881wasdetected,itislikelythattheosteoblasts harvestedandreportedhereareamixtureofcorticalandtrabec- ularosteoblasts.

However, most of these mice, whenmaintainedonvitaminandbileacidsupplements,hada normal life span.(55) Mutations in human HSD3B7 cause JournalofBoneandMineralResearchcongenital defects in bile acid synthesis.(56,57) While HSD3B1, another 3βHSD isoenzyme gene, participates in the resistance toandrogen-deprivationtherapyinprostatecancerpatients,(36) aroleforHSD3B7inprostatecancerortheskeletonhasnotbeen reported. Duringtheinitialinvasionofprostatecancercellstobone,the osteoblast may be the principal source of androgens. This hypothesis has not been directly tested because clinical trials have not been designed to address this question.

This observation was the basis for the development of androgen-deprivation therapies (ADT) to sup- presstesticulartestosterone(T)production.ADTincreasesover- all survival and progression-free survival in men with early castration-sensitive prostate cancer.(11) Unfortunately, most ADT-treated disease evolves into castration-resistant prostate cancer(CRPC),typicallywithin2yearsafterADTinitiation.(12,13) A mechanism that CRPC cells commonly use to evade ADT is eptedApril17,2021;AcceptedmanuscriptonlineApril26,2021. m,Endocrinology&Diabetes,DepartmentofInternalMedicine,Universityof enter, 2215 Fuller Road, Research 151, Ann Arbor, MI 48105-2399, USA. rticle. 79. asbeencontributedtobyUSGovernmentemployeesandtheirworkisinthe JournalofBoneandMineralResearchtheintratumoralsynthesisofandrogensfromtheabundantcircu- lating adrenal precursor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).(14–17) DHEAisproducedintheadrenalcortexandisthereforeunaffected byconventionalADT. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the most potent circulating androgenandissynthesizedfromTbyperipheraltissues,with an affinity for the androgen receptor (AR) two to three times greater than T.(18) DHEA conversion to DHT requires three ste- roidogenic enzymes: 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD),17β-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase(17βHSD),andste- roid 5α-reductase (SRD5α) (Fig. 1). Seven mouse and 3 human 3βHSD, atleast14 17βHSD(that includesproteinsencoded by AKR1C3 in humans, Akr1c6 in mice, RDH5, and RDH11), and 3 SRD5α steroidogenic isoforms have been discovered, each with unique tissue expression patterns. Other groups have reported that osteoblasts express the three steroidogenic enzymesrequiredforDHEAconversiontoTandDHT.(19–21)Both TandDHTbindAR,whichresultsinARdimerizationandtranslo- cation to the nucleus.

ConditionedmediaofosteoblaststreatedwithDHEA activateprostatecancerARsignaling The capacity for osteoblast-generated T to activate AR signaling in prostate cancer cells was next tested. Since the androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells also synthesize JournalofBoneandMineralResearch androgens from DHEA, the contributions of each cell type to generate androgens were determined. Residual T already pre- sent in osteoblast conditioned media(CM) would immediately activateprostatecancerARsignaling,whereasDHEAmustfirst beconvertedtoTorDHTinprostatecancercellsbeforeARsig- nalingwouldcommence. The prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and C4-2B were trans- duced with a lentivirus AR-reporter construct (tat3-GLuc) con- taining three AREs fused to a basal promoter and Gaussia luciferase (GLuc).(31) GLuc is a secreted protein that allows for easy collection of media over time as a measure of androgen receptorsignalingactivation.Thecellswerealsotransducedwith a lentivirus constitutively expressing DsRed, with fluorescence used to normalize GLuc values to relative cell number. The androgenanalogR1881robustlyincreasedGLucactivityinboth LNCaP and C4-2B prostate cancer cell lines (Supplemental Fig.S3).TheabilityofosteoblastCMtoactivateprostatecancer ARsignalingwasnextexamined(Fig.5).CMwascollectedfrom murine long-bone osteoblasts 72hours after treatment with 100nM and 1μM DHEA, or an ethanol vehicle control. More immediateincreasesinGLucwereexpectedfromTalreadypre- sentinDHEA-treatedosteoblastCMcomparedwithdirectDHEA treatmentoftheprostatecancercells.Afterprostatecancercells were transduced with the tat3-Gluc/DsRed lentivirus combina- tion, the media were replaced with 50% of the respective prostate cancer medium and 50% CM from osteoblasts that had been treated with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control. These groups were compared with the pros- tate cancer cells treated directy with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control along with 50% osteoblast CM treated with EtOH. As expected, the groups treated with ethanol vehicle CM or ethanol vehicle directly did not show AR signaling activation (Fig. 6). In both LNCaP and C4-2B cell lines, treatment with 100nM DHEA CM versus 100nM DHEA, and 1μM DHEA CM versus 1μM DHEA resulted in signifi- cantly more AR signaling activation at 12, 24, 36, and 48hours. Continued differences were detected in the LNCaP cell line at 72hours. In the C4-2B cell line, 100nM DHEA treatment at 72hours resulted in even greater AR signaling activation compared with the 100nM DHEA CM group. At 1μM DHEA CM compared with 1μM DHEA treatment, the degree of AR signaling activation was similar. EnzalutamideblocksprostatecancerARsignalinginduced byosteoblast-generatedandrogen Enzalutamide is an effective and specific androgen antagonist thatblocksthreeARactivationsteps:androgenbinding toAR, translocationoftheandrogen-ARcomplexto thenucleus, and the assocation of the androgen-AR complex to AREs.(34) To demonstrate the specificity of DHEA-treated osteoblast CM acting through AR signaling, the ability of enzalutamide to block AR signaling was tested. C4-2B prostate cancer cells were transduced with the tat3-GLuc/DsRed lentivirus combi- nation and treated with and without 1μM enzalutamide daily, as well as 100nM DHEA CM (Fig. 7A), 1μM DHEA CM (Fig. 7B), or ethanol vehicle control. Enzalutamide significantly blocked AR signaling of cells treated with 100nM DHEA CM and 1μM DHEA CM at 48 and 72hours. These data indicate specific AR signaling activation of prostate cancer cells by osteoblast-generated androgens. n OSTEOBLASTSGENERATETESTOSTERONE 1573Fig8.

The intratumoral generation of androgens is an important mechanismofCRPCprogression.(14–17)However,thefrequency anddegreeinwhichthisphenomenonoccurs,especiallyinbone metastasis, are unknown.

As bone metastasis progresses, the contribution of prostate cancer–generated androgenswouldthendependnotonlyoncellnumbersbutalso on the capacity of these prostate cancer cells to generate androgens. Toinvestigatehowosteoblast-generatedandrogenscontrib- utetoprostatecancerARsignalingandgrowth,astrategywas selected in which CM from osteoblasts after DHEA treatment wascomparedwiththedirecttreatmentofDHEA.Sinceosteo- blastsdidnotcompletelymetabolizeallDHEA,andandrostene- diolandandrostenedioneintermediateswerealsopresentinthe CM,thesesubstrateslikelycontributedtotheintratumoralgen- eration of androgens by prostate cancer cells. However, since enzymaticconversionofthesesubstratesbytheprostatecancer cellstakestime,thegreaterincreaseinARsignalingwiththeCM at the earlier time points is due to osteoblast-generated testosterone. Althoughosteoblast-generatedandrogens,asreportedhere, likely contribute to prostate cancer expansion in bone, other mechanisms ofprostatecancerregulationbyosteoblasts have beenreported.Inonereport,co-culturewiththepre-osteoblast cell line MC3T3 accentuated the DHT-regulated increase in MDA-PCa-2bprostatecancercellnumbers.(42)CMfromMC3T3 cellsalsoincreasedtheexpressionofARandthesteroidogenesis enzymes HSD3B1, AKR1C3, and SRD5A1 in the CRPC cell line LNCaP-19, leading to an increase in intratumoral androgen n 1576 MOONETAL. productionandapossibleincreaseinARsensitivity.(43)Further- more, the CM of human primary osteoblast cultures was reported to increase PSA production of LNCaP cells in the absenceofsteroidtreatment.Althoughasimilarresultwasnot foundinthedatapresentedhere,thismaysuggestdifferences betweenhumanandmouseprimaryosteoblastcultures.(44) TheLNCaPandC4-2Bprostatecancercellswereselectedfor further study because of the responsiveness to osteoblast- generatedandrogens.Theywerealsoselectedfortheirdissimi- larities in androgen production. Although LNCaP cells had a comparableabilitytogeneratetestosteroneasosteoblasts,the generationoftestosteronedidnotkeeppacewithtestosterone presentintheosteoblastCM.TheLNCaPprostatecancercellline demonstratedgreaterARsignaling,PSAsecretion,andcellnum- bers with DHEA CM treatments compared with DHEA added directlytotheculturemedia.C4-2Bcells,however,displayeddif- ferentkineticstoosteoblastCM.Atearliertimepointsandwith the100nMCMtreatment,therewasatrendforgreaterARsig- naling, PSA production, and cell growth. However, C4-2B AR signalingactivationatlatertimepointsandatthehigher1μM DHEAdirecttreatmentoutpacedtheandrogenpresentinosteo- blast CM. This was likely because of the robust conversion of DHEA to testosteroneandespecially DHTinthis cell line.Both celllinesdemonstratedarapidincreaseinPSAproductionwith the DHEA CM treatments since PSA is a robust, early indicator of AR activation, as previously reported.(45,46) In contrast, the increaseincellnumberswiththeDHEACMtreatmentsisacon- firmatorybutslowersignofandrogenaction.(47,48) The effects of DHEA and R1881 on AR signaling were also investigated in osteoblasts. Despite osteoblasts generating T fromDHEA,ARsignalingwasnotincreasedcomparedwithvehi- clecontrol.AlthoughtheconcentrationofTwassufficientforAR binding,theabsenceofDHTintheCMofDHEA-treatedosteo- blastswasapossiblecontributor.Osteoblastslacktheexpression ofSrd5a2thatencodesanenzymewithanaffinityforTthatis 14 to 20 times greater than the enzyme encoded by Srdr5a1.(49,50) The kinetics of the enzyme encoded by Srd5a3 areunknown.R1881didincreaseARsignalingmodestlyabove thevehiclecontrol.Thesedataindicatethatthemurineosteo- blasts harvested from the ends of long bones, specifically the epiphysealandmetaphysealregions,arenothighlysensitiveto androgens, despite AR expression. Although osteoblasts have beenreportedtobetargetsofandrogens,(42)thisisnottruewith osteoblastsinallskeletalcompartments.Theskeletalphenotype ofosteoblast-targetedgeneticdeletionofArhasbeenreported by a number of groups.(51–54) The consensus among these reportsisthattrabecularbonebutnotcorticalboneosteoblasts aresensitivetoARactionsinbothsexes.Becauseatleastapartial responsetoR1881wasdetected,itislikelythattheosteoblasts harvestedandreportedhereareamixtureofcorticalandtrabec- ularosteoblasts.

However, most of these mice, whenmaintainedonvitaminandbileacidsupplements,hada normal life span.(55) Mutations in human HSD3B7 cause JournalofBoneandMineralResearchcongenital defects in bile acid synthesis.(56,57) While HSD3B1, another 3βHSD isoenzyme gene, participates in the resistance toandrogen-deprivationtherapyinprostatecancerpatients,(36) aroleforHSD3B7inprostatecancerortheskeletonhasnotbeen reported. Duringtheinitialinvasionofprostatecancercellstobone,the osteoblast may be the principal source of androgens. This hypothesis has not been directly tested because clinical trials have not been designed to address this question.

Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the most potent circulating androgenandissynthesizedfromTbyperipheraltissues,with an affinity for the androgen receptor (AR) two to three times greater than T.(18) DHEA conversion to DHT requires three ste- roidogenic enzymes: 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD),17β-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase(17βHSD),andste- roid 5α-reductase (SRD5α) (Fig. 1). Seven mouse and 3 human 3βHSD, atleast14 17βHSD(that includesproteinsencoded by AKR1C3 in humans, Akr1c6 in mice, RDH5, and RDH11), and 3 SRD5α steroidogenic isoforms have been discovered, each with unique tissue expression patterns.

ConditionedmediaofosteoblaststreatedwithDHEA activateprostatecancerARsignaling The capacity for osteoblast-generated T to activate AR signaling in prostate cancer cells was next tested. Since the androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells also synthesize JournalofBoneandMineralResearch androgens from DHEA, the contributions of each cell type to generate androgens were determined. Residual T already pre- sent in osteoblast conditioned media(CM) would immediately activateprostatecancerARsignaling,whereasDHEAmustfirst beconvertedtoTorDHTinprostatecancercellsbeforeARsig- nalingwouldcommence. The prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and C4-2B were trans- duced with a lentivirus AR-reporter construct (tat3-GLuc) con- taining three AREs fused to a basal promoter and Gaussia luciferase (GLuc).(31) GLuc is a secreted protein that allows for easy collection of media over time as a measure of androgen receptorsignalingactivation.Thecellswerealsotransducedwith a lentivirus constitutively expressing DsRed, with fluorescence used to normalize GLuc values to relative cell number. The androgenanalogR1881robustlyincreasedGLucactivityinboth LNCaP and C4-2B prostate cancer cell lines (Supplemental Fig.S3).TheabilityofosteoblastCMtoactivateprostatecancer ARsignalingwasnextexamined(Fig.5).CMwascollectedfrom murine long-bone osteoblasts 72hours after treatment with 100nM and 1μM DHEA, or an ethanol vehicle control. More immediateincreasesinGLucwereexpectedfromTalreadypre- sentinDHEA-treatedosteoblastCMcomparedwithdirectDHEA treatmentoftheprostatecancercells.Afterprostatecancercells were transduced with the tat3-Gluc/DsRed lentivirus combina- tion, the media were replaced with 50% of the respective prostate cancer medium and 50% CM from osteoblasts that had been treated with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control. These groups were compared with the pros- tate cancer cells treated directy with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control along with 50% osteoblast CM treated with EtOH. As expected, the groups treated with ethanol vehicle CM or ethanol vehicle directly did not show AR signaling activation (Fig. 6). In both LNCaP and C4-2B cell lines, treatment with 100nM DHEA CM versus 100nM DHEA, and 1μM DHEA CM versus 1μM DHEA resulted in signifi- cantly more AR signaling activation at 12, 24, 36, and 48hours. Continued differences were detected in the LNCaP cell line at 72hours. In the C4-2B cell line, 100nM DHEA treatment at 72hours resulted in even greater AR signaling activation compared with the 100nM DHEA CM group. At 1μM DHEA CM compared with 1μM DHEA treatment, the degree of AR signaling activation was similar. EnzalutamideblocksprostatecancerARsignalinginduced byosteoblast-generatedandrogen Enzalutamide is an effective and specific androgen antagonist thatblocksthreeARactivationsteps:androgenbinding toAR, translocationoftheandrogen-ARcomplexto thenucleus, and the assocation of the androgen-AR complex to AREs.(34) To demonstrate the specificity of DHEA-treated osteoblast CM acting through AR signaling, the ability of enzalutamide to block AR signaling was tested. C4-2B prostate cancer cells were transduced with the tat3-GLuc/DsRed lentivirus combi- nation and treated with and without 1μM enzalutamide daily, as well as 100nM DHEA CM (Fig. 7A), 1μM DHEA CM (Fig. 7B), or ethanol vehicle control. Enzalutamide significantly blocked AR signaling of cells treated with 100nM DHEA CM and 1μM DHEA CM at 48 and 72hours. These data indicate specific AR signaling activation of prostate cancer cells by osteoblast-generated androgens. n OSTEOBLASTSGENERATETESTOSTERONE 1573Fig8.

As bone metastasis progresses, the contribution of prostate cancer–generated androgenswouldthendependnotonlyoncellnumbersbutalso on the capacity of these prostate cancer cells to generate androgens. Toinvestigatehowosteoblast-generatedandrogenscontrib- utetoprostatecancerARsignalingandgrowth,astrategywas selected in which CM from osteoblasts after DHEA treatment wascomparedwiththedirecttreatmentofDHEA.Sinceosteo- blastsdidnotcompletelymetabolizeallDHEA,andandrostene- diolandandrostenedioneintermediateswerealsopresentinthe CM,thesesubstrateslikelycontributedtotheintratumoralgen- eration of androgens by prostate cancer cells. However, since enzymaticconversionofthesesubstratesbytheprostatecancer cellstakestime,thegreaterincreaseinARsignalingwiththeCM at the earlier time points is due to osteoblast-generated testosterone. Althoughosteoblast-generatedandrogens,asreportedhere, likely contribute to prostate cancer expansion in bone, other mechanisms ofprostatecancerregulationbyosteoblasts have beenreported.Inonereport,co-culturewiththepre-osteoblast cell line MC3T3 accentuated the DHT-regulated increase in MDA-PCa-2bprostatecancercellnumbers.(42)CMfromMC3T3 cellsalsoincreasedtheexpressionofARandthesteroidogenesis enzymes HSD3B1, AKR1C3, and SRD5A1 in the CRPC cell line LNCaP-19, leading to an increase in intratumoral androgen n 1576 MOONETAL. productionandapossibleincreaseinARsensitivity.(43)Further- more, the CM of human primary osteoblast cultures was reported to increase PSA production of LNCaP cells in the absenceofsteroidtreatment.Althoughasimilarresultwasnot foundinthedatapresentedhere,thismaysuggestdifferences betweenhumanandmouseprimaryosteoblastcultures.(44) TheLNCaPandC4-2Bprostatecancercellswereselectedfor further study because of the responsiveness to osteoblast- generatedandrogens.Theywerealsoselectedfortheirdissimi- larities in androgen production. Although LNCaP cells had a comparableabilitytogeneratetestosteroneasosteoblasts,the generationoftestosteronedidnotkeeppacewithtestosterone presentintheosteoblastCM.TheLNCaPprostatecancercellline demonstratedgreaterARsignaling,PSAsecretion,andcellnum- bers with DHEA CM treatments compared with DHEA added directlytotheculturemedia.C4-2Bcells,however,displayeddif- ferentkineticstoosteoblastCM.Atearliertimepointsandwith the100nMCMtreatment,therewasatrendforgreaterARsig- naling, PSA production, and cell growth. However, C4-2B AR signalingactivationatlatertimepointsandatthehigher1μM DHEAdirecttreatmentoutpacedtheandrogenpresentinosteo- blast CM. This was likely because of the robust conversion of DHEA to testosteroneandespecially DHTinthis cell line.Both celllinesdemonstratedarapidincreaseinPSAproductionwith the DHEA CM treatments since PSA is a robust, early indicator of AR activation, as previously reported.(45,46) In contrast, the increaseincellnumberswiththeDHEACMtreatmentsisacon- firmatorybutslowersignofandrogenaction.(47,48) The effects of DHEA and R1881 on AR signaling were also investigated in osteoblasts. Despite osteoblasts generating T fromDHEA,ARsignalingwasnotincreasedcomparedwithvehi- clecontrol.AlthoughtheconcentrationofTwassufficientforAR binding,theabsenceofDHTintheCMofDHEA-treatedosteo- blastswasapossiblecontributor.Osteoblastslacktheexpression ofSrd5a2thatencodesanenzymewithanaffinityforTthatis 14 to 20 times greater than the enzyme encoded by Srdr5a1.(49,50) The kinetics of the enzyme encoded by Srd5a3 areunknown.R1881didincreaseARsignalingmodestlyabove thevehiclecontrol.Thesedataindicatethatthemurineosteo- blasts harvested from the ends of long bones, specifically the epiphysealandmetaphysealregions,arenothighlysensitiveto androgens, despite AR expression. Although osteoblasts have beenreportedtobetargetsofandrogens,(42)thisisnottruewith osteoblastsinallskeletalcompartments.Theskeletalphenotype ofosteoblast-targetedgeneticdeletionofArhasbeenreported by a number of groups.(51–54) The consensus among these reportsisthattrabecularbonebutnotcorticalboneosteoblasts aresensitivetoARactionsinbothsexes.Becauseatleastapartial responsetoR1881wasdetected,itislikelythattheosteoblasts harvestedandreportedhereareamixtureofcorticalandtrabec- ularosteoblasts.

This hypothesis has not been directly tested because clinical trials have not been designed to address this question. The pivotal clinicaltrialsevaluatingtheandrogensynthesisinhibitorabira- teroneacetateandtheandrogenreceptorantagonistenzaluta- mide reported an increase in overall survival and clinical progression-free survival when combined with ADT and com- paredwithADTaloneinpatientswithmetastaticprostatecancer, mostofwhomhadbonemetastasis.(58–60)However,thesestud- iescombinedtheradiographicprogressionofbonemetastasis withothercriteriaforprogression,suchassymptomaticskeletal events and progression of soft-tissue tumors. Data reporting solelyradiographicprogressionofbonemetastasesareunavail- able.

Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the most potent circulating androgenandissynthesizedfromTbyperipheraltissues,with an affinity for the androgen receptor (AR) two to three times greater than T.(18) DHEA conversion to DHT requires three ste- roidogenic enzymes: 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD),17β-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase(17βHSD),andste- roid 5α-reductase (SRD5α) (Fig. 1). Seven mouse and 3 human 3βHSD, atleast14 17βHSD(that includesproteinsencoded by AKR1C3 in humans, Akr1c6 in mice, RDH5, and RDH11), and 3 SRD5α steroidogenic isoforms have been discovered, each with unique tissue expression patterns.

Significant M androstenediolwasdetectedin22Rv1andARCaP ,andlessin M C4-2B and LNCaP. C4-2B generated significant T followed by 22Rv1, LNCaP, and ARCaP .

ConditionedmediaofosteoblaststreatedwithDHEA activateprostatecancerARsignaling The capacity for osteoblast-generated T to activate AR signaling in prostate cancer cells was next tested. Since the androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells also synthesize JournalofBoneandMineralResearch androgens from DHEA, the contributions of each cell type to generate androgens were determined. Residual T already pre- sent in osteoblast conditioned media(CM) would immediately activateprostatecancerARsignaling,whereasDHEAmustfirst beconvertedtoTorDHTinprostatecancercellsbeforeARsig- nalingwouldcommence. The prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and C4-2B were trans- duced with a lentivirus AR-reporter construct (tat3-GLuc) con- taining three AREs fused to a basal promoter and Gaussia luciferase (GLuc).(31) GLuc is a secreted protein that allows for easy collection of media over time as a measure of androgen receptorsignalingactivation.Thecellswerealsotransducedwith a lentivirus constitutively expressing DsRed, with fluorescence used to normalize GLuc values to relative cell number. The androgenanalogR1881robustlyincreasedGLucactivityinboth LNCaP and C4-2B prostate cancer cell lines (Supplemental Fig.S3).TheabilityofosteoblastCMtoactivateprostatecancer ARsignalingwasnextexamined(Fig.5).CMwascollectedfrom murine long-bone osteoblasts 72hours after treatment with 100nM and 1μM DHEA, or an ethanol vehicle control. More immediateincreasesinGLucwereexpectedfromTalreadypre- sentinDHEA-treatedosteoblastCMcomparedwithdirectDHEA treatmentoftheprostatecancercells.Afterprostatecancercells were transduced with the tat3-Gluc/DsRed lentivirus combina- tion, the media were replaced with 50% of the respective prostate cancer medium and 50% CM from osteoblasts that had been treated with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control. These groups were compared with the pros- tate cancer cells treated directy with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control along with 50% osteoblast CM treated with EtOH. As expected, the groups treated with ethanol vehicle CM or ethanol vehicle directly did not show AR signaling activation (Fig. 6). In both LNCaP and C4-2B cell lines, treatment with 100nM DHEA CM versus 100nM DHEA, and 1μM DHEA CM versus 1μM DHEA resulted in signifi- cantly more AR signaling activation at 12, 24, 36, and 48hours. Continued differences were detected in the LNCaP cell line at 72hours. In the C4-2B cell line, 100nM DHEA treatment at 72hours resulted in even greater AR signaling activation compared with the 100nM DHEA CM group. At 1μM DHEA CM compared with 1μM DHEA treatment, the degree of AR signaling activation was similar. EnzalutamideblocksprostatecancerARsignalinginduced byosteoblast-generatedandrogen Enzalutamide is an effective and specific androgen antagonist thatblocksthreeARactivationsteps:androgenbinding toAR, translocationoftheandrogen-ARcomplexto thenucleus, and the assocation of the androgen-AR complex to AREs.(34) To demonstrate the specificity of DHEA-treated osteoblast CM acting through AR signaling, the ability of enzalutamide to block AR signaling was tested. C4-2B prostate cancer cells were transduced with the tat3-GLuc/DsRed lentivirus combi- nation and treated with and without 1μM enzalutamide daily, as well as 100nM DHEA CM (Fig. 7A), 1μM DHEA CM (Fig. 7B), or ethanol vehicle control. Enzalutamide significantly blocked AR signaling of cells treated with 100nM DHEA CM and 1μM DHEA CM at 48 and 72hours. These data indicate specific AR signaling activation of prostate cancer cells by osteoblast-generated androgens. n OSTEOBLASTSGENERATETESTOSTERONE 1573Fig8.

The intratumoral generation of androgens is an important mechanismofCRPCprogression.(14–17)However,thefrequency anddegreeinwhichthisphenomenonoccurs,especiallyinbone metastasis, are unknown.

As bone metastasis progresses, the contribution of prostate cancer–generated androgenswouldthendependnotonlyoncellnumbersbutalso on the capacity of these prostate cancer cells to generate androgens. Toinvestigatehowosteoblast-generatedandrogenscontrib- utetoprostatecancerARsignalingandgrowth,astrategywas selected in which CM from osteoblasts after DHEA treatment wascomparedwiththedirecttreatmentofDHEA.Sinceosteo- blastsdidnotcompletelymetabolizeallDHEA,andandrostene- diolandandrostenedioneintermediateswerealsopresentinthe CM,thesesubstrateslikelycontributedtotheintratumoralgen- eration of androgens by prostate cancer cells. However, since enzymaticconversionofthesesubstratesbytheprostatecancer cellstakestime,thegreaterincreaseinARsignalingwiththeCM at the earlier time points is due to osteoblast-generated testosterone. Althoughosteoblast-generatedandrogens,asreportedhere, likely contribute to prostate cancer expansion in bone, other mechanisms ofprostatecancerregulationbyosteoblasts have beenreported.Inonereport,co-culturewiththepre-osteoblast cell line MC3T3 accentuated the DHT-regulated increase in MDA-PCa-2bprostatecancercellnumbers.(42)CMfromMC3T3 cellsalsoincreasedtheexpressionofARandthesteroidogenesis enzymes HSD3B1, AKR1C3, and SRD5A1 in the CRPC cell line LNCaP-19, leading to an increase in intratumoral androgen n 1576 MOONETAL. productionandapossibleincreaseinARsensitivity.(43)Further- more, the CM of human primary osteoblast cultures was reported to increase PSA production of LNCaP cells in the absenceofsteroidtreatment.Althoughasimilarresultwasnot foundinthedatapresentedhere,thismaysuggestdifferences betweenhumanandmouseprimaryosteoblastcultures.(44) TheLNCaPandC4-2Bprostatecancercellswereselectedfor further study because of the responsiveness to osteoblast- generatedandrogens.Theywerealsoselectedfortheirdissimi- larities in androgen production. Although LNCaP cells had a comparableabilitytogeneratetestosteroneasosteoblasts,the generationoftestosteronedidnotkeeppacewithtestosterone presentintheosteoblastCM.TheLNCaPprostatecancercellline demonstratedgreaterARsignaling,PSAsecretion,andcellnum- bers with DHEA CM treatments compared with DHEA added directlytotheculturemedia.C4-2Bcells,however,displayeddif- ferentkineticstoosteoblastCM.Atearliertimepointsandwith the100nMCMtreatment,therewasatrendforgreaterARsig- naling, PSA production, and cell growth. However, C4-2B AR signalingactivationatlatertimepointsandatthehigher1μM DHEAdirecttreatmentoutpacedtheandrogenpresentinosteo- blast CM. This was likely because of the robust conversion of DHEA to testosteroneandespecially DHTinthis cell line.Both celllinesdemonstratedarapidincreaseinPSAproductionwith the DHEA CM treatments since PSA is a robust, early indicator of AR activation, as previously reported.(45,46) In contrast, the increaseincellnumberswiththeDHEACMtreatmentsisacon- firmatorybutslowersignofandrogenaction.(47,48) The effects of DHEA and R1881 on AR signaling were also investigated in osteoblasts. Despite osteoblasts generating T fromDHEA,ARsignalingwasnotincreasedcomparedwithvehi- clecontrol.AlthoughtheconcentrationofTwassufficientforAR binding,theabsenceofDHTintheCMofDHEA-treatedosteo- blastswasapossiblecontributor.Osteoblastslacktheexpression ofSrd5a2thatencodesanenzymewithanaffinityforTthatis 14 to 20 times greater than the enzyme encoded by Srdr5a1.(49,50) The kinetics of the enzyme encoded by Srd5a3 areunknown.R1881didincreaseARsignalingmodestlyabove thevehiclecontrol.Thesedataindicatethatthemurineosteo- blasts harvested from the ends of long bones, specifically the epiphysealandmetaphysealregions,arenothighlysensitiveto androgens, despite AR expression. Although osteoblasts have beenreportedtobetargetsofandrogens,(42)thisisnottruewith osteoblastsinallskeletalcompartments.Theskeletalphenotype ofosteoblast-targetedgeneticdeletionofArhasbeenreported by a number of groups.(51–54) The consensus among these reportsisthattrabecularbonebutnotcorticalboneosteoblasts aresensitivetoARactionsinbothsexes.Becauseatleastapartial responsetoR1881wasdetected,itislikelythattheosteoblasts harvestedandreportedhereareamixtureofcorticalandtrabec- ularosteoblasts.

However, most of these mice, whenmaintainedonvitaminandbileacidsupplements,hada normal life span.(55) Mutations in human HSD3B7 cause JournalofBoneandMineralResearchcongenital defects in bile acid synthesis.(56,57) While HSD3B1, another 3βHSD isoenzyme gene, participates in the resistance toandrogen-deprivationtherapyinprostatecancerpatients,(36) aroleforHSD3B7inprostatecancerortheskeletonhasnotbeen reported. Duringtheinitialinvasionofprostatecancercellstobone,the osteoblast may be the principal source of androgens. This hypothesis has not been directly tested because clinical trials have not been designed to address this question.

This observation was the basis for the development of androgen-deprivation therapies (ADT) to sup- presstesticulartestosterone(T)production.ADTincreasesover- all survival and progression-free survival in men with early castration-sensitive prostate cancer.(11) Unfortunately, most ADT-treated disease evolves into castration-resistant prostate cancer(CRPC),typicallywithin2yearsafterADTinitiation.(12,13) A mechanism that CRPC cells commonly use to evade ADT is eptedApril17,2021;AcceptedmanuscriptonlineApril26,2021. m,Endocrinology&Diabetes,DepartmentofInternalMedicine,Universityof enter, 2215 Fuller Road, Research 151, Ann Arbor, MI 48105-2399, USA. rticle. 79. asbeencontributedtobyUSGovernmentemployeesandtheirworkisinthe JournalofBoneandMineralResearchtheintratumoralsynthesisofandrogensfromtheabundantcircu- lating adrenal precursor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).(14–17) DHEAisproducedintheadrenalcortexandisthereforeunaffected byconventionalADT. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the most potent circulating androgenandissynthesizedfromTbyperipheraltissues,with an affinity for the androgen receptor (AR) two to three times greater than T.(18) DHEA conversion to DHT requires three ste- roidogenic enzymes: 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD),17β-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase(17βHSD),andste- roid 5α-reductase (SRD5α) (Fig. 1). Seven mouse and 3 human 3βHSD, atleast14 17βHSD(that includesproteinsencoded by AKR1C3 in humans, Akr1c6 in mice, RDH5, and RDH11), and 3 SRD5α steroidogenic isoforms have been discovered, each with unique tissue expression patterns. Other groups have reported that osteoblasts express the three steroidogenic enzymesrequiredforDHEAconversiontoTandDHT.(19–21)Both TandDHTbindAR,whichresultsinARdimerizationandtranslo- cation to the nucleus.

ConditionedmediaofosteoblaststreatedwithDHEA activateprostatecancerARsignaling The capacity for osteoblast-generated T to activate AR signaling in prostate cancer cells was next tested. Since the androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells also synthesize JournalofBoneandMineralResearch androgens from DHEA, the contributions of each cell type to generate androgens were determined. Residual T already pre- sent in osteoblast conditioned media(CM) would immediately activateprostatecancerARsignaling,whereasDHEAmustfirst beconvertedtoTorDHTinprostatecancercellsbeforeARsig- nalingwouldcommence. The prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and C4-2B were trans- duced with a lentivirus AR-reporter construct (tat3-GLuc) con- taining three AREs fused to a basal promoter and Gaussia luciferase (GLuc).(31) GLuc is a secreted protein that allows for easy collection of media over time as a measure of androgen receptorsignalingactivation.Thecellswerealsotransducedwith a lentivirus constitutively expressing DsRed, with fluorescence used to normalize GLuc values to relative cell number. The androgenanalogR1881robustlyincreasedGLucactivityinboth LNCaP and C4-2B prostate cancer cell lines (Supplemental Fig.S3).TheabilityofosteoblastCMtoactivateprostatecancer ARsignalingwasnextexamined(Fig.5).CMwascollectedfrom murine long-bone osteoblasts 72hours after treatment with 100nM and 1μM DHEA, or an ethanol vehicle control. More immediateincreasesinGLucwereexpectedfromTalreadypre- sentinDHEA-treatedosteoblastCMcomparedwithdirectDHEA treatmentoftheprostatecancercells.Afterprostatecancercells were transduced with the tat3-Gluc/DsRed lentivirus combina- tion, the media were replaced with 50% of the respective prostate cancer medium and 50% CM from osteoblasts that had been treated with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control. These groups were compared with the pros- tate cancer cells treated directy with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control along with 50% osteoblast CM treated with EtOH. As expected, the groups treated with ethanol vehicle CM or ethanol vehicle directly did not show AR signaling activation (Fig. 6). In both LNCaP and C4-2B cell lines, treatment with 100nM DHEA CM versus 100nM DHEA, and 1μM DHEA CM versus 1μM DHEA resulted in signifi- cantly more AR signaling activation at 12, 24, 36, and 48hours. Continued differences were detected in the LNCaP cell line at 72hours. In the C4-2B cell line, 100nM DHEA treatment at 72hours resulted in even greater AR signaling activation compared with the 100nM DHEA CM group. At 1μM DHEA CM compared with 1μM DHEA treatment, the degree of AR signaling activation was similar. EnzalutamideblocksprostatecancerARsignalinginduced byosteoblast-generatedandrogen Enzalutamide is an effective and specific androgen antagonist thatblocksthreeARactivationsteps:androgenbinding toAR, translocationoftheandrogen-ARcomplexto thenucleus, and the assocation of the androgen-AR complex to AREs.(34) To demonstrate the specificity of DHEA-treated osteoblast CM acting through AR signaling, the ability of enzalutamide to block AR signaling was tested. C4-2B prostate cancer cells were transduced with the tat3-GLuc/DsRed lentivirus combi- nation and treated with and without 1μM enzalutamide daily, as well as 100nM DHEA CM (Fig. 7A), 1μM DHEA CM (Fig. 7B), or ethanol vehicle control. Enzalutamide significantly blocked AR signaling of cells treated with 100nM DHEA CM and 1μM DHEA CM at 48 and 72hours. These data indicate specific AR signaling activation of prostate cancer cells by osteoblast-generated androgens. n OSTEOBLASTSGENERATETESTOSTERONE 1573Fig8.

As bone metastasis progresses, the contribution of prostate cancer–generated androgenswouldthendependnotonlyoncellnumbersbutalso on the capacity of these prostate cancer cells to generate androgens. Toinvestigatehowosteoblast-generatedandrogenscontrib- utetoprostatecancerARsignalingandgrowth,astrategywas selected in which CM from osteoblasts after DHEA treatment wascomparedwiththedirecttreatmentofDHEA.Sinceosteo- blastsdidnotcompletelymetabolizeallDHEA,andandrostene- diolandandrostenedioneintermediateswerealsopresentinthe CM,thesesubstrateslikelycontributedtotheintratumoralgen- eration of androgens by prostate cancer cells. However, since enzymaticconversionofthesesubstratesbytheprostatecancer cellstakestime,thegreaterincreaseinARsignalingwiththeCM at the earlier time points is due to osteoblast-generated testosterone. Althoughosteoblast-generatedandrogens,asreportedhere, likely contribute to prostate cancer expansion in bone, other mechanisms ofprostatecancerregulationbyosteoblasts have beenreported.Inonereport,co-culturewiththepre-osteoblast cell line MC3T3 accentuated the DHT-regulated increase in MDA-PCa-2bprostatecancercellnumbers.(42)CMfromMC3T3 cellsalsoincreasedtheexpressionofARandthesteroidogenesis enzymes HSD3B1, AKR1C3, and SRD5A1 in the CRPC cell line LNCaP-19, leading to an increase in intratumoral androgen n 1576 MOONETAL. productionandapossibleincreaseinARsensitivity.(43)Further- more, the CM of human primary osteoblast cultures was reported to increase PSA production of LNCaP cells in the absenceofsteroidtreatment.Althoughasimilarresultwasnot foundinthedatapresentedhere,thismaysuggestdifferences betweenhumanandmouseprimaryosteoblastcultures.(44) TheLNCaPandC4-2Bprostatecancercellswereselectedfor further study because of the responsiveness to osteoblast- generatedandrogens.Theywerealsoselectedfortheirdissimi- larities in androgen production. Although LNCaP cells had a comparableabilitytogeneratetestosteroneasosteoblasts,the generationoftestosteronedidnotkeeppacewithtestosterone presentintheosteoblastCM.TheLNCaPprostatecancercellline demonstratedgreaterARsignaling,PSAsecretion,andcellnum- bers with DHEA CM treatments compared with DHEA added directlytotheculturemedia.C4-2Bcells,however,displayeddif- ferentkineticstoosteoblastCM.Atearliertimepointsandwith the100nMCMtreatment,therewasatrendforgreaterARsig- naling, PSA production, and cell growth. However, C4-2B AR signalingactivationatlatertimepointsandatthehigher1μM DHEAdirecttreatmentoutpacedtheandrogenpresentinosteo- blast CM. This was likely because of the robust conversion of DHEA to testosteroneandespecially DHTinthis cell line.Both celllinesdemonstratedarapidincreaseinPSAproductionwith the DHEA CM treatments since PSA is a robust, early indicator of AR activation, as previously reported.(45,46) In contrast, the increaseincellnumberswiththeDHEACMtreatmentsisacon- firmatorybutslowersignofandrogenaction.(47,48) The effects of DHEA and R1881 on AR signaling were also investigated in osteoblasts. Despite osteoblasts generating T fromDHEA,ARsignalingwasnotincreasedcomparedwithvehi- clecontrol.AlthoughtheconcentrationofTwassufficientforAR binding,theabsenceofDHTintheCMofDHEA-treatedosteo- blastswasapossiblecontributor.Osteoblastslacktheexpression ofSrd5a2thatencodesanenzymewithanaffinityforTthatis 14 to 20 times greater than the enzyme encoded by Srdr5a1.(49,50) The kinetics of the enzyme encoded by Srd5a3 areunknown.R1881didincreaseARsignalingmodestlyabove thevehiclecontrol.Thesedataindicatethatthemurineosteo- blasts harvested from the ends of long bones, specifically the epiphysealandmetaphysealregions,arenothighlysensitiveto androgens, despite AR expression. Although osteoblasts have beenreportedtobetargetsofandrogens,(42)thisisnottruewith osteoblastsinallskeletalcompartments.Theskeletalphenotype ofosteoblast-targetedgeneticdeletionofArhasbeenreported by a number of groups.(51–54) The consensus among these reportsisthattrabecularbonebutnotcorticalboneosteoblasts aresensitivetoARactionsinbothsexes.Becauseatleastapartial responsetoR1881wasdetected,itislikelythattheosteoblasts harvestedandreportedhereareamixtureofcorticalandtrabec- ularosteoblasts.

However, most of these mice, whenmaintainedonvitaminandbileacidsupplements,hada normal life span.(55) Mutations in human HSD3B7 cause JournalofBoneandMineralResearchcongenital defects in bile acid synthesis.(56,57) While HSD3B1, another 3βHSD isoenzyme gene, participates in the resistance toandrogen-deprivationtherapyinprostatecancerpatients,(36) aroleforHSD3B7inprostatecancerortheskeletonhasnotbeen reported. Duringtheinitialinvasionofprostatecancercellstobone,the osteoblast may be the principal source of androgens.

Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the most potent circulating androgenandissynthesizedfromTbyperipheraltissues,with an affinity for the androgen receptor (AR) two to three times greater than T.(18) DHEA conversion to DHT requires three ste- roidogenic enzymes: 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD),17β-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase(17βHSD),andste- roid 5α-reductase (SRD5α) (Fig. 1). Seven mouse and 3 human 3βHSD, atleast14 17βHSD(that includesproteinsencoded by AKR1C3 in humans, Akr1c6 in mice, RDH5, and RDH11), and 3 SRD5α steroidogenic isoforms have been discovered, each with unique tissue expression patterns.

ConditionedmediaofosteoblaststreatedwithDHEA activateprostatecancerARsignaling The capacity for osteoblast-generated T to activate AR signaling in prostate cancer cells was next tested. Since the androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells also synthesize JournalofBoneandMineralResearch androgens from DHEA, the contributions of each cell type to generate androgens were determined. Residual T already pre- sent in osteoblast conditioned media(CM) would immediately activateprostatecancerARsignaling,whereasDHEAmustfirst beconvertedtoTorDHTinprostatecancercellsbeforeARsig- nalingwouldcommence. The prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and C4-2B were trans- duced with a lentivirus AR-reporter construct (tat3-GLuc) con- taining three AREs fused to a basal promoter and Gaussia luciferase (GLuc).(31) GLuc is a secreted protein that allows for easy collection of media over time as a measure of androgen receptorsignalingactivation.Thecellswerealsotransducedwith a lentivirus constitutively expressing DsRed, with fluorescence used to normalize GLuc values to relative cell number. The androgenanalogR1881robustlyincreasedGLucactivityinboth LNCaP and C4-2B prostate cancer cell lines (Supplemental Fig.S3).TheabilityofosteoblastCMtoactivateprostatecancer ARsignalingwasnextexamined(Fig.5).CMwascollectedfrom murine long-bone osteoblasts 72hours after treatment with 100nM and 1μM DHEA, or an ethanol vehicle control. More immediateincreasesinGLucwereexpectedfromTalreadypre- sentinDHEA-treatedosteoblastCMcomparedwithdirectDHEA treatmentoftheprostatecancercells.Afterprostatecancercells were transduced with the tat3-Gluc/DsRed lentivirus combina- tion, the media were replaced with 50% of the respective prostate cancer medium and 50% CM from osteoblasts that had been treated with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control. These groups were compared with the pros- tate cancer cells treated directy with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control along with 50% osteoblast CM treated with EtOH. As expected, the groups treated with ethanol vehicle CM or ethanol vehicle directly did not show AR signaling activation (Fig. 6). In both LNCaP and C4-2B cell lines, treatment with 100nM DHEA CM versus 100nM DHEA, and 1μM DHEA CM versus 1μM DHEA resulted in signifi- cantly more AR signaling activation at 12, 24, 36, and 48hours. Continued differences were detected in the LNCaP cell line at 72hours. In the C4-2B cell line, 100nM DHEA treatment at 72hours resulted in even greater AR signaling activation compared with the 100nM DHEA CM group. At 1μM DHEA CM compared with 1μM DHEA treatment, the degree of AR signaling activation was similar. EnzalutamideblocksprostatecancerARsignalinginduced byosteoblast-generatedandrogen Enzalutamide is an effective and specific androgen antagonist thatblocksthreeARactivationsteps:androgenbinding toAR, translocationoftheandrogen-ARcomplexto thenucleus, and the assocation of the androgen-AR complex to AREs.(34) To demonstrate the specificity of DHEA-treated osteoblast CM acting through AR signaling, the ability of enzalutamide to block AR signaling was tested. C4-2B prostate cancer cells were transduced with the tat3-GLuc/DsRed lentivirus combi- nation and treated with and without 1μM enzalutamide daily, as well as 100nM DHEA CM (Fig. 7A), 1μM DHEA CM (Fig. 7B), or ethanol vehicle control. Enzalutamide significantly blocked AR signaling of cells treated with 100nM DHEA CM and 1μM DHEA CM at 48 and 72hours. These data indicate specific AR signaling activation of prostate cancer cells by osteoblast-generated androgens. n OSTEOBLASTSGENERATETESTOSTERONE 1573Fig8.

As bone metastasis progresses, the contribution of prostate cancer–generated androgenswouldthendependnotonlyoncellnumbersbutalso on the capacity of these prostate cancer cells to generate androgens. Toinvestigatehowosteoblast-generatedandrogenscontrib- utetoprostatecancerARsignalingandgrowth,astrategywas selected in which CM from osteoblasts after DHEA treatment wascomparedwiththedirecttreatmentofDHEA.Sinceosteo- blastsdidnotcompletelymetabolizeallDHEA,andandrostene- diolandandrostenedioneintermediateswerealsopresentinthe CM,thesesubstrateslikelycontributedtotheintratumoralgen- eration of androgens by prostate cancer cells. However, since enzymaticconversionofthesesubstratesbytheprostatecancer cellstakestime,thegreaterincreaseinARsignalingwiththeCM at the earlier time points is due to osteoblast-generated testosterone. Althoughosteoblast-generatedandrogens,asreportedhere, likely contribute to prostate cancer expansion in bone, other mechanisms ofprostatecancerregulationbyosteoblasts have beenreported.Inonereport,co-culturewiththepre-osteoblast cell line MC3T3 accentuated the DHT-regulated increase in MDA-PCa-2bprostatecancercellnumbers.(42)CMfromMC3T3 cellsalsoincreasedtheexpressionofARandthesteroidogenesis enzymes HSD3B1, AKR1C3, and SRD5A1 in the CRPC cell line LNCaP-19, leading to an increase in intratumoral androgen n 1576 MOONETAL. productionandapossibleincreaseinARsensitivity.(43)Further- more, the CM of human primary osteoblast cultures was reported to increase PSA production of LNCaP cells in the absenceofsteroidtreatment.Althoughasimilarresultwasnot foundinthedatapresentedhere,thismaysuggestdifferences betweenhumanandmouseprimaryosteoblastcultures.(44) TheLNCaPandC4-2Bprostatecancercellswereselectedfor further study because of the responsiveness to osteoblast- generatedandrogens.Theywerealsoselectedfortheirdissimi- larities in androgen production. Although LNCaP cells had a comparableabilitytogeneratetestosteroneasosteoblasts,the generationoftestosteronedidnotkeeppacewithtestosterone presentintheosteoblastCM.TheLNCaPprostatecancercellline demonstratedgreaterARsignaling,PSAsecretion,andcellnum- bers with DHEA CM treatments compared with DHEA added directlytotheculturemedia.C4-2Bcells,however,displayeddif- ferentkineticstoosteoblastCM.Atearliertimepointsandwith the100nMCMtreatment,therewasatrendforgreaterARsig- naling, PSA production, and cell growth. However, C4-2B AR signalingactivationatlatertimepointsandatthehigher1μM DHEAdirecttreatmentoutpacedtheandrogenpresentinosteo- blast CM. This was likely because of the robust conversion of DHEA to testosteroneandespecially DHTinthis cell line.Both celllinesdemonstratedarapidincreaseinPSAproductionwith the DHEA CM treatments since PSA is a robust, early indicator of AR activation, as previously reported.(45,46) In contrast, the increaseincellnumberswiththeDHEACMtreatmentsisacon- firmatorybutslowersignofandrogenaction.(47,48) The effects of DHEA and R1881 on AR signaling were also investigated in osteoblasts. Despite osteoblasts generating T fromDHEA,ARsignalingwasnotincreasedcomparedwithvehi- clecontrol.AlthoughtheconcentrationofTwassufficientforAR binding,theabsenceofDHTintheCMofDHEA-treatedosteo- blastswasapossiblecontributor.Osteoblastslacktheexpression ofSrd5a2thatencodesanenzymewithanaffinityforTthatis 14 to 20 times greater than the enzyme encoded by Srdr5a1.(49,50) The kinetics of the enzyme encoded by Srd5a3 areunknown.R1881didincreaseARsignalingmodestlyabove thevehiclecontrol.Thesedataindicatethatthemurineosteo- blasts harvested from the ends of long bones, specifically the epiphysealandmetaphysealregions,arenothighlysensitiveto androgens, despite AR expression. Although osteoblasts have beenreportedtobetargetsofandrogens,(42)thisisnottruewith osteoblastsinallskeletalcompartments.Theskeletalphenotype ofosteoblast-targetedgeneticdeletionofArhasbeenreported by a number of groups.(51–54) The consensus among these reportsisthattrabecularbonebutnotcorticalboneosteoblasts aresensitivetoARactionsinbothsexes.Becauseatleastapartial responsetoR1881wasdetected,itislikelythattheosteoblasts harvestedandreportedhereareamixtureofcorticalandtrabec- ularosteoblasts.

This hypothesis has not been directly tested because clinical trials have not been designed to address this question.

Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the most potent circulating androgenandissynthesizedfromTbyperipheraltissues,with an affinity for the androgen receptor (AR) two to three times greater than T.(18) DHEA conversion to DHT requires three ste- roidogenic enzymes: 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD),17β-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase(17βHSD),andste- roid 5α-reductase (SRD5α) (Fig. 1). Seven mouse and 3 human 3βHSD, atleast14 17βHSD(that includesproteinsencoded by AKR1C3 in humans, Akr1c6 in mice, RDH5, and RDH11), and 3 SRD5α steroidogenic isoforms have been discovered, each with unique tissue expression patterns.

Significant M androstenediolwasdetectedin22Rv1andARCaP ,andlessin M C4-2B and LNCaP. C4-2B generated significant T followed by 22Rv1, LNCaP, and ARCaP .

ConditionedmediaofosteoblaststreatedwithDHEA activateprostatecancerARsignaling The capacity for osteoblast-generated T to activate AR signaling in prostate cancer cells was next tested. Since the androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells also synthesize JournalofBoneandMineralResearch androgens from DHEA, the contributions of each cell type to generate androgens were determined. Residual T already pre- sent in osteoblast conditioned media(CM) would immediately activateprostatecancerARsignaling,whereasDHEAmustfirst beconvertedtoTorDHTinprostatecancercellsbeforeARsig- nalingwouldcommence. The prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and C4-2B were trans- duced with a lentivirus AR-reporter construct (tat3-GLuc) con- taining three AREs fused to a basal promoter and Gaussia luciferase (GLuc).(31) GLuc is a secreted protein that allows for easy collection of media over time as a measure of androgen receptorsignalingactivation.Thecellswerealsotransducedwith a lentivirus constitutively expressing DsRed, with fluorescence used to normalize GLuc values to relative cell number. The androgenanalogR1881robustlyincreasedGLucactivityinboth LNCaP and C4-2B prostate cancer cell lines (Supplemental Fig.S3).TheabilityofosteoblastCMtoactivateprostatecancer ARsignalingwasnextexamined(Fig.5).CMwascollectedfrom murine long-bone osteoblasts 72hours after treatment with 100nM and 1μM DHEA, or an ethanol vehicle control. More immediateincreasesinGLucwereexpectedfromTalreadypre- sentinDHEA-treatedosteoblastCMcomparedwithdirectDHEA treatmentoftheprostatecancercells.Afterprostatecancercells were transduced with the tat3-Gluc/DsRed lentivirus combina- tion, the media were replaced with 50% of the respective prostate cancer medium and 50% CM from osteoblasts that had been treated with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control. These groups were compared with the pros- tate cancer cells treated directy with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control along with 50% osteoblast CM treated with EtOH. As expected, the groups treated with ethanol vehicle CM or ethanol vehicle directly did not show AR signaling activation (Fig. 6). In both LNCaP and C4-2B cell lines, treatment with 100nM DHEA CM versus 100nM DHEA, and 1μM DHEA CM versus 1μM DHEA resulted in signifi- cantly more AR signaling activation at 12, 24, 36, and 48hours. Continued differences were detected in the LNCaP cell line at 72hours. In the C4-2B cell line, 100nM DHEA treatment at 72hours resulted in even greater AR signaling activation compared with the 100nM DHEA CM group. At 1μM DHEA CM compared with 1μM DHEA treatment, the degree of AR signaling activation was similar. EnzalutamideblocksprostatecancerARsignalinginduced byosteoblast-generatedandrogen Enzalutamide is an effective and specific androgen antagonist thatblocksthreeARactivationsteps:androgenbinding toAR, translocationoftheandrogen-ARcomplexto thenucleus, and the assocation of the androgen-AR complex to AREs.(34) To demonstrate the specificity of DHEA-treated osteoblast CM acting through AR signaling, the ability of enzalutamide to block AR signaling was tested. C4-2B prostate cancer cells were transduced with the tat3-GLuc/DsRed lentivirus combi- nation and treated with and without 1μM enzalutamide daily, as well as 100nM DHEA CM (Fig. 7A), 1μM DHEA CM (Fig. 7B), or ethanol vehicle control. Enzalutamide significantly blocked AR signaling of cells treated with 100nM DHEA CM and 1μM DHEA CM at 48 and 72hours. These data indicate specific AR signaling activation of prostate cancer cells by osteoblast-generated androgens. n OSTEOBLASTSGENERATETESTOSTERONE 1573Fig8.

The intratumoral generation of androgens is an important mechanismofCRPCprogression.(14–17)However,thefrequency anddegreeinwhichthisphenomenonoccurs,especiallyinbone metastasis, are unknown.

As bone metastasis progresses, the contribution of prostate cancer–generated androgenswouldthendependnotonlyoncellnumbersbutalso on the capacity of these prostate cancer cells to generate androgens. Toinvestigatehowosteoblast-generatedandrogenscontrib- utetoprostatecancerARsignalingandgrowth,astrategywas selected in which CM from osteoblasts after DHEA treatment wascomparedwiththedirecttreatmentofDHEA.Sinceosteo- blastsdidnotcompletelymetabolizeallDHEA,andandrostene- diolandandrostenedioneintermediateswerealsopresentinthe CM,thesesubstrateslikelycontributedtotheintratumoralgen- eration of androgens by prostate cancer cells. However, since enzymaticconversionofthesesubstratesbytheprostatecancer cellstakestime,thegreaterincreaseinARsignalingwiththeCM at the earlier time points is due to osteoblast-generated testosterone. Althoughosteoblast-generatedandrogens,asreportedhere, likely contribute to prostate cancer expansion in bone, other mechanisms ofprostatecancerregulationbyosteoblasts have beenreported.Inonereport,co-culturewiththepre-osteoblast cell line MC3T3 accentuated the DHT-regulated increase in MDA-PCa-2bprostatecancercellnumbers.(42)CMfromMC3T3 cellsalsoincreasedtheexpressionofARandthesteroidogenesis enzymes HSD3B1, AKR1C3, and SRD5A1 in the CRPC cell line LNCaP-19, leading to an increase in intratumoral androgen n 1576 MOONETAL. productionandapossibleincreaseinARsensitivity.(43)Further- more, the CM of human primary osteoblast cultures was reported to increase PSA production of LNCaP cells in the absenceofsteroidtreatment.Althoughasimilarresultwasnot foundinthedatapresentedhere,thismaysuggestdifferences betweenhumanandmouseprimaryosteoblastcultures.(44) TheLNCaPandC4-2Bprostatecancercellswereselectedfor further study because of the responsiveness to osteoblast- generatedandrogens.Theywerealsoselectedfortheirdissimi- larities in androgen production. Although LNCaP cells had a comparableabilitytogeneratetestosteroneasosteoblasts,the generationoftestosteronedidnotkeeppacewithtestosterone presentintheosteoblastCM.TheLNCaPprostatecancercellline demonstratedgreaterARsignaling,PSAsecretion,andcellnum- bers with DHEA CM treatments compared with DHEA added directlytotheculturemedia.C4-2Bcells,however,displayeddif- ferentkineticstoosteoblastCM.Atearliertimepointsandwith the100nMCMtreatment,therewasatrendforgreaterARsig- naling, PSA production, and cell growth. However, C4-2B AR signalingactivationatlatertimepointsandatthehigher1μM DHEAdirecttreatmentoutpacedtheandrogenpresentinosteo- blast CM. This was likely because of the robust conversion of DHEA to testosteroneandespecially DHTinthis cell line.Both celllinesdemonstratedarapidincreaseinPSAproductionwith the DHEA CM treatments since PSA is a robust, early indicator of AR activation, as previously reported.(45,46) In contrast, the increaseincellnumberswiththeDHEACMtreatmentsisacon- firmatorybutslowersignofandrogenaction.(47,48) The effects of DHEA and R1881 on AR signaling were also investigated in osteoblasts. Despite osteoblasts generating T fromDHEA,ARsignalingwasnotincreasedcomparedwithvehi- clecontrol.AlthoughtheconcentrationofTwassufficientforAR binding,theabsenceofDHTintheCMofDHEA-treatedosteo- blastswasapossiblecontributor.Osteoblastslacktheexpression ofSrd5a2thatencodesanenzymewithanaffinityforTthatis 14 to 20 times greater than the enzyme encoded by Srdr5a1.(49,50) The kinetics of the enzyme encoded by Srd5a3 areunknown.R1881didincreaseARsignalingmodestlyabove thevehiclecontrol.Thesedataindicatethatthemurineosteo- blasts harvested from the ends of long bones, specifically the epiphysealandmetaphysealregions,arenothighlysensitiveto androgens, despite AR expression. Although osteoblasts have beenreportedtobetargetsofandrogens,(42)thisisnottruewith osteoblastsinallskeletalcompartments.Theskeletalphenotype ofosteoblast-targetedgeneticdeletionofArhasbeenreported by a number of groups.(51–54) The consensus among these reportsisthattrabecularbonebutnotcorticalboneosteoblasts aresensitivetoARactionsinbothsexes.Becauseatleastapartial responsetoR1881wasdetected,itislikelythattheosteoblasts harvestedandreportedhereareamixtureofcorticalandtrabec- ularosteoblasts.

However, most of these mice, whenmaintainedonvitaminandbileacidsupplements,hada normal life span.(55) Mutations in human HSD3B7 cause JournalofBoneandMineralResearchcongenital defects in bile acid synthesis.(56,57) While HSD3B1, another 3βHSD isoenzyme gene, participates in the resistance toandrogen-deprivationtherapyinprostatecancerpatients,(36) aroleforHSD3B7inprostatecancerortheskeletonhasnotbeen reported. Duringtheinitialinvasionofprostatecancercellstobone,the osteoblast may be the principal source of androgens. This hypothesis has not been directly tested because clinical trials have not been designed to address this question.

This observation was the basis for the development of androgen-deprivation therapies (ADT) to sup- presstesticulartestosterone(T)production.ADTincreasesover- all survival and progression-free survival in men with early castration-sensitive prostate cancer.(11) Unfortunately, most ADT-treated disease evolves into castration-resistant prostate cancer(CRPC),typicallywithin2yearsafterADTinitiation.(12,13) A mechanism that CRPC cells commonly use to evade ADT is eptedApril17,2021;AcceptedmanuscriptonlineApril26,2021. m,Endocrinology&Diabetes,DepartmentofInternalMedicine,Universityof enter, 2215 Fuller Road, Research 151, Ann Arbor, MI 48105-2399, USA. rticle. 79. asbeencontributedtobyUSGovernmentemployeesandtheirworkisinthe JournalofBoneandMineralResearchtheintratumoralsynthesisofandrogensfromtheabundantcircu- lating adrenal precursor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).(14–17) DHEAisproducedintheadrenalcortexandisthereforeunaffected byconventionalADT. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the most potent circulating androgenandissynthesizedfromTbyperipheraltissues,with an affinity for the androgen receptor (AR) two to three times greater than T.(18) DHEA conversion to DHT requires three ste- roidogenic enzymes: 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD),17β-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase(17βHSD),andste- roid 5α-reductase (SRD5α) (Fig. 1). Seven mouse and 3 human 3βHSD, atleast14 17βHSD(that includesproteinsencoded by AKR1C3 in humans, Akr1c6 in mice, RDH5, and RDH11), and 3 SRD5α steroidogenic isoforms have been discovered, each with unique tissue expression patterns. Other groups have reported that osteoblasts express the three steroidogenic enzymesrequiredforDHEAconversiontoTandDHT.(19–21)Both TandDHTbindAR,whichresultsinARdimerizationandtranslo- cation to the nucleus.

ConditionedmediaofosteoblaststreatedwithDHEA activateprostatecancerARsignaling The capacity for osteoblast-generated T to activate AR signaling in prostate cancer cells was next tested. Since the androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells also synthesize JournalofBoneandMineralResearch androgens from DHEA, the contributions of each cell type to generate androgens were determined. Residual T already pre- sent in osteoblast conditioned media(CM) would immediately activateprostatecancerARsignaling,whereasDHEAmustfirst beconvertedtoTorDHTinprostatecancercellsbeforeARsig- nalingwouldcommence. The prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and C4-2B were trans- duced with a lentivirus AR-reporter construct (tat3-GLuc) con- taining three AREs fused to a basal promoter and Gaussia luciferase (GLuc).(31) GLuc is a secreted protein that allows for easy collection of media over time as a measure of androgen receptorsignalingactivation.Thecellswerealsotransducedwith a lentivirus constitutively expressing DsRed, with fluorescence used to normalize GLuc values to relative cell number. The androgenanalogR1881robustlyincreasedGLucactivityinboth LNCaP and C4-2B prostate cancer cell lines (Supplemental Fig.S3).TheabilityofosteoblastCMtoactivateprostatecancer ARsignalingwasnextexamined(Fig.5).CMwascollectedfrom murine long-bone osteoblasts 72hours after treatment with 100nM and 1μM DHEA, or an ethanol vehicle control. More immediateincreasesinGLucwereexpectedfromTalreadypre- sentinDHEA-treatedosteoblastCMcomparedwithdirectDHEA treatmentoftheprostatecancercells.Afterprostatecancercells were transduced with the tat3-Gluc/DsRed lentivirus combina- tion, the media were replaced with 50% of the respective prostate cancer medium and 50% CM from osteoblasts that had been treated with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control. These groups were compared with the pros- tate cancer cells treated directy with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control along with 50% osteoblast CM treated with EtOH. As expected, the groups treated with ethanol vehicle CM or ethanol vehicle directly did not show AR signaling activation (Fig. 6). In both LNCaP and C4-2B cell lines, treatment with 100nM DHEA CM versus 100nM DHEA, and 1μM DHEA CM versus 1μM DHEA resulted in signifi- cantly more AR signaling activation at 12, 24, 36, and 48hours. Continued differences were detected in the LNCaP cell line at 72hours. In the C4-2B cell line, 100nM DHEA treatment at 72hours resulted in even greater AR signaling activation compared with the 100nM DHEA CM group. At 1μM DHEA CM compared with 1μM DHEA treatment, the degree of AR signaling activation was similar. EnzalutamideblocksprostatecancerARsignalinginduced byosteoblast-generatedandrogen Enzalutamide is an effective and specific androgen antagonist thatblocksthreeARactivationsteps:androgenbinding toAR, translocationoftheandrogen-ARcomplexto thenucleus, and the assocation of the androgen-AR complex to AREs.(34) To demonstrate the specificity of DHEA-treated osteoblast CM acting through AR signaling, the ability of enzalutamide to block AR signaling was tested. C4-2B prostate cancer cells were transduced with the tat3-GLuc/DsRed lentivirus combi- nation and treated with and without 1μM enzalutamide daily, as well as 100nM DHEA CM (Fig. 7A), 1μM DHEA CM (Fig. 7B), or ethanol vehicle control. Enzalutamide significantly blocked AR signaling of cells treated with 100nM DHEA CM and 1μM DHEA CM at 48 and 72hours. These data indicate specific AR signaling activation of prostate cancer cells by osteoblast-generated androgens. n OSTEOBLASTSGENERATETESTOSTERONE 1573Fig8.

The intratumoral generation of androgens is an important mechanismofCRPCprogression.(14–17)However,thefrequency anddegreeinwhichthisphenomenonoccurs,especiallyinbone metastasis, are unknown.

As bone metastasis progresses, the contribution of prostate cancer–generated androgenswouldthendependnotonlyoncellnumbersbutalso on the capacity of these prostate cancer cells to generate androgens. Toinvestigatehowosteoblast-generatedandrogenscontrib- utetoprostatecancerARsignalingandgrowth,astrategywas selected in which CM from osteoblasts after DHEA treatment wascomparedwiththedirecttreatmentofDHEA.Sinceosteo- blastsdidnotcompletelymetabolizeallDHEA,andandrostene- diolandandrostenedioneintermediateswerealsopresentinthe CM,thesesubstrateslikelycontributedtotheintratumoralgen- eration of androgens by prostate cancer cells. However, since enzymaticconversionofthesesubstratesbytheprostatecancer cellstakestime,thegreaterincreaseinARsignalingwiththeCM at the earlier time points is due to osteoblast-generated testosterone. Althoughosteoblast-generatedandrogens,asreportedhere, likely contribute to prostate cancer expansion in bone, other mechanisms ofprostatecancerregulationbyosteoblasts have beenreported.Inonereport,co-culturewiththepre-osteoblast cell line MC3T3 accentuated the DHT-regulated increase in MDA-PCa-2bprostatecancercellnumbers.(42)CMfromMC3T3 cellsalsoincreasedtheexpressionofARandthesteroidogenesis enzymes HSD3B1, AKR1C3, and SRD5A1 in the CRPC cell line LNCaP-19, leading to an increase in intratumoral androgen n 1576 MOONETAL. productionandapossibleincreaseinARsensitivity.(43)Further- more, the CM of human primary osteoblast cultures was reported to increase PSA production of LNCaP cells in the absenceofsteroidtreatment.Althoughasimilarresultwasnot foundinthedatapresentedhere,thismaysuggestdifferences betweenhumanandmouseprimaryosteoblastcultures.(44) TheLNCaPandC4-2Bprostatecancercellswereselectedfor further study because of the responsiveness to osteoblast- generatedandrogens.Theywerealsoselectedfortheirdissimi- larities in androgen production. Although LNCaP cells had a comparableabilitytogeneratetestosteroneasosteoblasts,the generationoftestosteronedidnotkeeppacewithtestosterone presentintheosteoblastCM.TheLNCaPprostatecancercellline demonstratedgreaterARsignaling,PSAsecretion,andcellnum- bers with DHEA CM treatments compared with DHEA added directlytotheculturemedia.C4-2Bcells,however,displayeddif- ferentkineticstoosteoblastCM.Atearliertimepointsandwith the100nMCMtreatment,therewasatrendforgreaterARsig- naling, PSA production, and cell growth. However, C4-2B AR signalingactivationatlatertimepointsandatthehigher1μM DHEAdirecttreatmentoutpacedtheandrogenpresentinosteo- blast CM. This was likely because of the robust conversion of DHEA to testosteroneandespecially DHTinthis cell line.Both celllinesdemonstratedarapidincreaseinPSAproductionwith the DHEA CM treatments since PSA is a robust, early indicator of AR activation, as previously reported.(45,46) In contrast, the increaseincellnumberswiththeDHEACMtreatmentsisacon- firmatorybutslowersignofandrogenaction.(47,48) The effects of DHEA and R1881 on AR signaling were also investigated in osteoblasts. Despite osteoblasts generating T fromDHEA,ARsignalingwasnotincreasedcomparedwithvehi- clecontrol.AlthoughtheconcentrationofTwassufficientforAR binding,theabsenceofDHTintheCMofDHEA-treatedosteo- blastswasapossiblecontributor.Osteoblastslacktheexpression ofSrd5a2thatencodesanenzymewithanaffinityforTthatis 14 to 20 times greater than the enzyme encoded by Srdr5a1.(49,50) The kinetics of the enzyme encoded by Srd5a3 areunknown.R1881didincreaseARsignalingmodestlyabove thevehiclecontrol.Thesedataindicatethatthemurineosteo- blasts harvested from the ends of long bones, specifically the epiphysealandmetaphysealregions,arenothighlysensitiveto androgens, despite AR expression. Although osteoblasts have beenreportedtobetargetsofandrogens,(42)thisisnottruewith osteoblastsinallskeletalcompartments.Theskeletalphenotype ofosteoblast-targetedgeneticdeletionofArhasbeenreported by a number of groups.(51–54) The consensus among these reportsisthattrabecularbonebutnotcorticalboneosteoblasts aresensitivetoARactionsinbothsexes.Becauseatleastapartial responsetoR1881wasdetected,itislikelythattheosteoblasts harvestedandreportedhereareamixtureofcorticalandtrabec- ularosteoblasts.

However, most of these mice, whenmaintainedonvitaminandbileacidsupplements,hada normal life span.(55) Mutations in human HSD3B7 cause JournalofBoneandMineralResearchcongenital defects in bile acid synthesis.(56,57) While HSD3B1, another 3βHSD isoenzyme gene, participates in the resistance toandrogen-deprivationtherapyinprostatecancerpatients,(36) aroleforHSD3B7inprostatecancerortheskeletonhasnotbeen reported. Duringtheinitialinvasionofprostatecancercellstobone,the osteoblast may be the principal source of androgens. This hypothesis has not been directly tested because clinical trials have not been designed to address this question.

Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the most potent circulating androgenandissynthesizedfromTbyperipheraltissues,with an affinity for the androgen receptor (AR) two to three times greater than T.(18) DHEA conversion to DHT requires three ste- roidogenic enzymes: 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD),17β-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase(17βHSD),andste- roid 5α-reductase (SRD5α) (Fig. 1). Seven mouse and 3 human 3βHSD, atleast14 17βHSD(that includesproteinsencoded by AKR1C3 in humans, Akr1c6 in mice, RDH5, and RDH11), and 3 SRD5α steroidogenic isoforms have been discovered, each with unique tissue expression patterns.

ConditionedmediaofosteoblaststreatedwithDHEA activateprostatecancerARsignaling The capacity for osteoblast-generated T to activate AR signaling in prostate cancer cells was next tested. Since the androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells also synthesize JournalofBoneandMineralResearch androgens from DHEA, the contributions of each cell type to generate androgens were determined. Residual T already pre- sent in osteoblast conditioned media(CM) would immediately activateprostatecancerARsignaling,whereasDHEAmustfirst beconvertedtoTorDHTinprostatecancercellsbeforeARsig- nalingwouldcommence. The prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and C4-2B were trans- duced with a lentivirus AR-reporter construct (tat3-GLuc) con- taining three AREs fused to a basal promoter and Gaussia luciferase (GLuc).(31) GLuc is a secreted protein that allows for easy collection of media over time as a measure of androgen receptorsignalingactivation.Thecellswerealsotransducedwith a lentivirus constitutively expressing DsRed, with fluorescence used to normalize GLuc values to relative cell number. The androgenanalogR1881robustlyincreasedGLucactivityinboth LNCaP and C4-2B prostate cancer cell lines (Supplemental Fig.S3).TheabilityofosteoblastCMtoactivateprostatecancer ARsignalingwasnextexamined(Fig.5).CMwascollectedfrom murine long-bone osteoblasts 72hours after treatment with 100nM and 1μM DHEA, or an ethanol vehicle control. More immediateincreasesinGLucwereexpectedfromTalreadypre- sentinDHEA-treatedosteoblastCMcomparedwithdirectDHEA treatmentoftheprostatecancercells.Afterprostatecancercells were transduced with the tat3-Gluc/DsRed lentivirus combina- tion, the media were replaced with 50% of the respective prostate cancer medium and 50% CM from osteoblasts that had been treated with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control. These groups were compared with the pros- tate cancer cells treated directy with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control along with 50% osteoblast CM treated with EtOH. As expected, the groups treated with ethanol vehicle CM or ethanol vehicle directly did not show AR signaling activation (Fig. 6). In both LNCaP and C4-2B cell lines, treatment with 100nM DHEA CM versus 100nM DHEA, and 1μM DHEA CM versus 1μM DHEA resulted in signifi- cantly more AR signaling activation at 12, 24, 36, and 48hours. Continued differences were detected in the LNCaP cell line at 72hours. In the C4-2B cell line, 100nM DHEA treatment at 72hours resulted in even greater AR signaling activation compared with the 100nM DHEA CM group. At 1μM DHEA CM compared with 1μM DHEA treatment, the degree of AR signaling activation was similar. EnzalutamideblocksprostatecancerARsignalinginduced byosteoblast-generatedandrogen Enzalutamide is an effective and specific androgen antagonist thatblocksthreeARactivationsteps:androgenbinding toAR, translocationoftheandrogen-ARcomplexto thenucleus, and the assocation of the androgen-AR complex to AREs.(34) To demonstrate the specificity of DHEA-treated osteoblast CM acting through AR signaling, the ability of enzalutamide to block AR signaling was tested. C4-2B prostate cancer cells were transduced with the tat3-GLuc/DsRed lentivirus combi- nation and treated with and without 1μM enzalutamide daily, as well as 100nM DHEA CM (Fig. 7A), 1μM DHEA CM (Fig. 7B), or ethanol vehicle control. Enzalutamide significantly blocked AR signaling of cells treated with 100nM DHEA CM and 1μM DHEA CM at 48 and 72hours. These data indicate specific AR signaling activation of prostate cancer cells by osteoblast-generated androgens. n OSTEOBLASTSGENERATETESTOSTERONE 1573Fig8.

As bone metastasis progresses, the contribution of prostate cancer–generated androgenswouldthendependnotonlyoncellnumbersbutalso on the capacity of these prostate cancer cells to generate androgens. Toinvestigatehowosteoblast-generatedandrogenscontrib- utetoprostatecancerARsignalingandgrowth,astrategywas selected in which CM from osteoblasts after DHEA treatment wascomparedwiththedirecttreatmentofDHEA.Sinceosteo- blastsdidnotcompletelymetabolizeallDHEA,andandrostene- diolandandrostenedioneintermediateswerealsopresentinthe CM,thesesubstrateslikelycontributedtotheintratumoralgen- eration of androgens by prostate cancer cells. However, since enzymaticconversionofthesesubstratesbytheprostatecancer cellstakestime,thegreaterincreaseinARsignalingwiththeCM at the earlier time points is due to osteoblast-generated testosterone. Althoughosteoblast-generatedandrogens,asreportedhere, likely contribute to prostate cancer expansion in bone, other mechanisms ofprostatecancerregulationbyosteoblasts have beenreported.Inonereport,co-culturewiththepre-osteoblast cell line MC3T3 accentuated the DHT-regulated increase in MDA-PCa-2bprostatecancercellnumbers.(42)CMfromMC3T3 cellsalsoincreasedtheexpressionofARandthesteroidogenesis enzymes HSD3B1, AKR1C3, and SRD5A1 in the CRPC cell line LNCaP-19, leading to an increase in intratumoral androgen n 1576 MOONETAL. productionandapossibleincreaseinARsensitivity.(43)Further- more, the CM of human primary osteoblast cultures was reported to increase PSA production of LNCaP cells in the absenceofsteroidtreatment.Althoughasimilarresultwasnot foundinthedatapresentedhere,thismaysuggestdifferences betweenhumanandmouseprimaryosteoblastcultures.(44) TheLNCaPandC4-2Bprostatecancercellswereselectedfor further study because of the responsiveness to osteoblast- generatedandrogens.Theywerealsoselectedfortheirdissimi- larities in androgen production. Although LNCaP cells had a comparableabilitytogeneratetestosteroneasosteoblasts,the generationoftestosteronedidnotkeeppacewithtestosterone presentintheosteoblastCM.TheLNCaPprostatecancercellline demonstratedgreaterARsignaling,PSAsecretion,andcellnum- bers with DHEA CM treatments compared with DHEA added directlytotheculturemedia.C4-2Bcells,however,displayeddif- ferentkineticstoosteoblastCM.Atearliertimepointsandwith the100nMCMtreatment,therewasatrendforgreaterARsig- naling, PSA production, and cell growth. However, C4-2B AR signalingactivationatlatertimepointsandatthehigher1μM DHEAdirecttreatmentoutpacedtheandrogenpresentinosteo- blast CM. This was likely because of the robust conversion of DHEA to testosteroneandespecially DHTinthis cell line.Both celllinesdemonstratedarapidincreaseinPSAproductionwith the DHEA CM treatments since PSA is a robust, early indicator of AR activation, as previously reported.(45,46) In contrast, the increaseincellnumberswiththeDHEACMtreatmentsisacon- firmatorybutslowersignofandrogenaction.(47,48) The effects of DHEA and R1881 on AR signaling were also investigated in osteoblasts. Despite osteoblasts generating T fromDHEA,ARsignalingwasnotincreasedcomparedwithvehi- clecontrol.AlthoughtheconcentrationofTwassufficientforAR binding,theabsenceofDHTintheCMofDHEA-treatedosteo- blastswasapossiblecontributor.Osteoblastslacktheexpression ofSrd5a2thatencodesanenzymewithanaffinityforTthatis 14 to 20 times greater than the enzyme encoded by Srdr5a1.(49,50) The kinetics of the enzyme encoded by Srd5a3 areunknown.R1881didincreaseARsignalingmodestlyabove thevehiclecontrol.Thesedataindicatethatthemurineosteo- blasts harvested from the ends of long bones, specifically the epiphysealandmetaphysealregions,arenothighlysensitiveto androgens, despite AR expression. Although osteoblasts have beenreportedtobetargetsofandrogens,(42)thisisnottruewith osteoblastsinallskeletalcompartments.Theskeletalphenotype ofosteoblast-targetedgeneticdeletionofArhasbeenreported by a number of groups.(51–54) The consensus among these reportsisthattrabecularbonebutnotcorticalboneosteoblasts aresensitivetoARactionsinbothsexes.Becauseatleastapartial responsetoR1881wasdetected,itislikelythattheosteoblasts harvestedandreportedhereareamixtureofcorticalandtrabec- ularosteoblasts.

This hypothesis has not been directly tested because clinical trials have not been designed to address this question. The pivotal clinicaltrialsevaluatingtheandrogensynthesisinhibitorabira- teroneacetateandtheandrogenreceptorantagonistenzaluta- mide reported an increase in overall survival and clinical progression-free survival when combined with ADT and com- paredwithADTaloneinpatientswithmetastaticprostatecancer, mostofwhomhadbonemetastasis.(58–60)However,thesestud- iescombinedtheradiographicprogressionofbonemetastasis withothercriteriaforprogression,suchassymptomaticskeletal events and progression of soft-tissue tumors. Data reporting solelyradiographicprogressionofbonemetastasesareunavail- able.

Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the most potent circulating androgenandissynthesizedfromTbyperipheraltissues,with an affinity for the androgen receptor (AR) two to three times greater than T.(18) DHEA conversion to DHT requires three ste- roidogenic enzymes: 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD),17β-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase(17βHSD),andste- roid 5α-reductase (SRD5α) (Fig. 1). Seven mouse and 3 human 3βHSD, atleast14 17βHSD(that includesproteinsencoded by AKR1C3 in humans, Akr1c6 in mice, RDH5, and RDH11), and 3 SRD5α steroidogenic isoforms have been discovered, each with unique tissue expression patterns.

Significant M androstenediolwasdetectedin22Rv1andARCaP ,andlessin M C4-2B and LNCaP. C4-2B generated significant T followed by 22Rv1, LNCaP, and ARCaP .

ConditionedmediaofosteoblaststreatedwithDHEA activateprostatecancerARsignaling The capacity for osteoblast-generated T to activate AR signaling in prostate cancer cells was next tested. Since the androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells also synthesize JournalofBoneandMineralResearch androgens from DHEA, the contributions of each cell type to generate androgens were determined. Residual T already pre- sent in osteoblast conditioned media(CM) would immediately activateprostatecancerARsignaling,whereasDHEAmustfirst beconvertedtoTorDHTinprostatecancercellsbeforeARsig- nalingwouldcommence. The prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and C4-2B were trans- duced with a lentivirus AR-reporter construct (tat3-GLuc) con- taining three AREs fused to a basal promoter and Gaussia luciferase (GLuc).(31) GLuc is a secreted protein that allows for easy collection of media over time as a measure of androgen receptorsignalingactivation.Thecellswerealsotransducedwith a lentivirus constitutively expressing DsRed, with fluorescence used to normalize GLuc values to relative cell number. The androgenanalogR1881robustlyincreasedGLucactivityinboth LNCaP and C4-2B prostate cancer cell lines (Supplemental Fig.S3).TheabilityofosteoblastCMtoactivateprostatecancer ARsignalingwasnextexamined(Fig.5).CMwascollectedfrom murine long-bone osteoblasts 72hours after treatment with 100nM and 1μM DHEA, or an ethanol vehicle control. More immediateincreasesinGLucwereexpectedfromTalreadypre- sentinDHEA-treatedosteoblastCMcomparedwithdirectDHEA treatmentoftheprostatecancercells.Afterprostatecancercells were transduced with the tat3-Gluc/DsRed lentivirus combina- tion, the media were replaced with 50% of the respective prostate cancer medium and 50% CM from osteoblasts that had been treated with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control. These groups were compared with the pros- tate cancer cells treated directy with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control along with 50% osteoblast CM treated with EtOH. As expected, the groups treated with ethanol vehicle CM or ethanol vehicle directly did not show AR signaling activation (Fig. 6). In both LNCaP and C4-2B cell lines, treatment with 100nM DHEA CM versus 100nM DHEA, and 1μM DHEA CM versus 1μM DHEA resulted in signifi- cantly more AR signaling activation at 12, 24, 36, and 48hours. Continued differences were detected in the LNCaP cell line at 72hours. In the C4-2B cell line, 100nM DHEA treatment at 72hours resulted in even greater AR signaling activation compared with the 100nM DHEA CM group. At 1μM DHEA CM compared with 1μM DHEA treatment, the degree of AR signaling activation was similar. EnzalutamideblocksprostatecancerARsignalinginduced byosteoblast-generatedandrogen Enzalutamide is an effective and specific androgen antagonist thatblocksthreeARactivationsteps:androgenbinding toAR, translocationoftheandrogen-ARcomplexto thenucleus, and the assocation of the androgen-AR complex to AREs.(34) To demonstrate the specificity of DHEA-treated osteoblast CM acting through AR signaling, the ability of enzalutamide to block AR signaling was tested. C4-2B prostate cancer cells were transduced with the tat3-GLuc/DsRed lentivirus combi- nation and treated with and without 1μM enzalutamide daily, as well as 100nM DHEA CM (Fig. 7A), 1μM DHEA CM (Fig. 7B), or ethanol vehicle control. Enzalutamide significantly blocked AR signaling of cells treated with 100nM DHEA CM and 1μM DHEA CM at 48 and 72hours. These data indicate specific AR signaling activation of prostate cancer cells by osteoblast-generated androgens. n OSTEOBLASTSGENERATETESTOSTERONE 1573Fig8.

The intratumoral generation of androgens is an important mechanismofCRPCprogression.(14–17)However,thefrequency anddegreeinwhichthisphenomenonoccurs,especiallyinbone metastasis, are unknown.

As bone metastasis progresses, the contribution of prostate cancer–generated androgenswouldthendependnotonlyoncellnumbersbutalso on the capacity of these prostate cancer cells to generate androgens. Toinvestigatehowosteoblast-generatedandrogenscontrib- utetoprostatecancerARsignalingandgrowth,astrategywas selected in which CM from osteoblasts after DHEA treatment wascomparedwiththedirecttreatmentofDHEA.Sinceosteo- blastsdidnotcompletelymetabolizeallDHEA,andandrostene- diolandandrostenedioneintermediateswerealsopresentinthe CM,thesesubstrateslikelycontributedtotheintratumoralgen- eration of androgens by prostate cancer cells. However, since enzymaticconversionofthesesubstratesbytheprostatecancer cellstakestime,thegreaterincreaseinARsignalingwiththeCM at the earlier time points is due to osteoblast-generated testosterone. Althoughosteoblast-generatedandrogens,asreportedhere, likely contribute to prostate cancer expansion in bone, other mechanisms ofprostatecancerregulationbyosteoblasts have beenreported.Inonereport,co-culturewiththepre-osteoblast cell line MC3T3 accentuated the DHT-regulated increase in MDA-PCa-2bprostatecancercellnumbers.(42)CMfromMC3T3 cellsalsoincreasedtheexpressionofARandthesteroidogenesis enzymes HSD3B1, AKR1C3, and SRD5A1 in the CRPC cell line LNCaP-19, leading to an increase in intratumoral androgen n 1576 MOONETAL. productionandapossibleincreaseinARsensitivity.(43)Further- more, the CM of human primary osteoblast cultures was reported to increase PSA production of LNCaP cells in the absenceofsteroidtreatment.Althoughasimilarresultwasnot foundinthedatapresentedhere,thismaysuggestdifferences betweenhumanandmouseprimaryosteoblastcultures.(44) TheLNCaPandC4-2Bprostatecancercellswereselectedfor further study because of the responsiveness to osteoblast- generatedandrogens.Theywerealsoselectedfortheirdissimi- larities in androgen production. Although LNCaP cells had a comparableabilitytogeneratetestosteroneasosteoblasts,the generationoftestosteronedidnotkeeppacewithtestosterone presentintheosteoblastCM.TheLNCaPprostatecancercellline demonstratedgreaterARsignaling,PSAsecretion,andcellnum- bers with DHEA CM treatments compared with DHEA added directlytotheculturemedia.C4-2Bcells,however,displayeddif- ferentkineticstoosteoblastCM.Atearliertimepointsandwith the100nMCMtreatment,therewasatrendforgreaterARsig- naling, PSA production, and cell growth. However, C4-2B AR signalingactivationatlatertimepointsandatthehigher1μM DHEAdirecttreatmentoutpacedtheandrogenpresentinosteo- blast CM. This was likely because of the robust conversion of DHEA to testosteroneandespecially DHTinthis cell line.Both celllinesdemonstratedarapidincreaseinPSAproductionwith the DHEA CM treatments since PSA is a robust, early indicator of AR activation, as previously reported.(45,46) In contrast, the increaseincellnumberswiththeDHEACMtreatmentsisacon- firmatorybutslowersignofandrogenaction.(47,48) The effects of DHEA and R1881 on AR signaling were also investigated in osteoblasts. Despite osteoblasts generating T fromDHEA,ARsignalingwasnotincreasedcomparedwithvehi- clecontrol.AlthoughtheconcentrationofTwassufficientforAR binding,theabsenceofDHTintheCMofDHEA-treatedosteo- blastswasapossiblecontributor.Osteoblastslacktheexpression ofSrd5a2thatencodesanenzymewithanaffinityforTthatis 14 to 20 times greater than the enzyme encoded by Srdr5a1.(49,50) The kinetics of the enzyme encoded by Srd5a3 areunknown.R1881didincreaseARsignalingmodestlyabove thevehiclecontrol.Thesedataindicatethatthemurineosteo- blasts harvested from the ends of long bones, specifically the epiphysealandmetaphysealregions,arenothighlysensitiveto androgens, despite AR expression. Although osteoblasts have beenreportedtobetargetsofandrogens,(42)thisisnottruewith osteoblastsinallskeletalcompartments.Theskeletalphenotype ofosteoblast-targetedgeneticdeletionofArhasbeenreported by a number of groups.(51–54) The consensus among these reportsisthattrabecularbonebutnotcorticalboneosteoblasts aresensitivetoARactionsinbothsexes.Becauseatleastapartial responsetoR1881wasdetected,itislikelythattheosteoblasts harvestedandreportedhereareamixtureofcorticalandtrabec- ularosteoblasts.

However, most of these mice, whenmaintainedonvitaminandbileacidsupplements,hada normal life span.(55) Mutations in human HSD3B7 cause JournalofBoneandMineralResearchcongenital defects in bile acid synthesis.(56,57) While HSD3B1, another 3βHSD isoenzyme gene, participates in the resistance toandrogen-deprivationtherapyinprostatecancerpatients,(36) aroleforHSD3B7inprostatecancerortheskeletonhasnotbeen reported. Duringtheinitialinvasionofprostatecancercellstobone,the osteoblast may be the principal source of androgens. This hypothesis has not been directly tested because clinical trials have not been designed to address this question.

This observation was the basis for the development of androgen-deprivation therapies (ADT) to sup- presstesticulartestosterone(T)production.ADTincreasesover- all survival and progression-free survival in men with early castration-sensitive prostate cancer.(11) Unfortunately, most ADT-treated disease evolves into castration-resistant prostate cancer(CRPC),typicallywithin2yearsafterADTinitiation.(12,13) A mechanism that CRPC cells commonly use to evade ADT is eptedApril17,2021;AcceptedmanuscriptonlineApril26,2021. m,Endocrinology&Diabetes,DepartmentofInternalMedicine,Universityof enter, 2215 Fuller Road, Research 151, Ann Arbor, MI 48105-2399, USA. rticle. 79. asbeencontributedtobyUSGovernmentemployeesandtheirworkisinthe JournalofBoneandMineralResearchtheintratumoralsynthesisofandrogensfromtheabundantcircu- lating adrenal precursor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).(14–17) DHEAisproducedintheadrenalcortexandisthereforeunaffected byconventionalADT. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the most potent circulating androgenandissynthesizedfromTbyperipheraltissues,with an affinity for the androgen receptor (AR) two to three times greater than T.(18) DHEA conversion to DHT requires three ste- roidogenic enzymes: 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD),17β-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase(17βHSD),andste- roid 5α-reductase (SRD5α) (Fig. 1). Seven mouse and 3 human 3βHSD, atleast14 17βHSD(that includesproteinsencoded by AKR1C3 in humans, Akr1c6 in mice, RDH5, and RDH11), and 3 SRD5α steroidogenic isoforms have been discovered, each with unique tissue expression patterns. Other groups have reported that osteoblasts express the three steroidogenic enzymesrequiredforDHEAconversiontoTandDHT.(19–21)Both TandDHTbindAR,whichresultsinARdimerizationandtranslo- cation to the nucleus.

ConditionedmediaofosteoblaststreatedwithDHEA activateprostatecancerARsignaling The capacity for osteoblast-generated T to activate AR signaling in prostate cancer cells was next tested. Since the androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells also synthesize JournalofBoneandMineralResearch androgens from DHEA, the contributions of each cell type to generate androgens were determined. Residual T already pre- sent in osteoblast conditioned media(CM) would immediately activateprostatecancerARsignaling,whereasDHEAmustfirst beconvertedtoTorDHTinprostatecancercellsbeforeARsig- nalingwouldcommence. The prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and C4-2B were trans- duced with a lentivirus AR-reporter construct (tat3-GLuc) con- taining three AREs fused to a basal promoter and Gaussia luciferase (GLuc).(31) GLuc is a secreted protein that allows for easy collection of media over time as a measure of androgen receptorsignalingactivation.Thecellswerealsotransducedwith a lentivirus constitutively expressing DsRed, with fluorescence used to normalize GLuc values to relative cell number. The androgenanalogR1881robustlyincreasedGLucactivityinboth LNCaP and C4-2B prostate cancer cell lines (Supplemental Fig.S3).TheabilityofosteoblastCMtoactivateprostatecancer ARsignalingwasnextexamined(Fig.5).CMwascollectedfrom murine long-bone osteoblasts 72hours after treatment with 100nM and 1μM DHEA, or an ethanol vehicle control. More immediateincreasesinGLucwereexpectedfromTalreadypre- sentinDHEA-treatedosteoblastCMcomparedwithdirectDHEA treatmentoftheprostatecancercells.Afterprostatecancercells were transduced with the tat3-Gluc/DsRed lentivirus combina- tion, the media were replaced with 50% of the respective prostate cancer medium and 50% CM from osteoblasts that had been treated with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control. These groups were compared with the pros- tate cancer cells treated directy with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control along with 50% osteoblast CM treated with EtOH. As expected, the groups treated with ethanol vehicle CM or ethanol vehicle directly did not show AR signaling activation (Fig. 6). In both LNCaP and C4-2B cell lines, treatment with 100nM DHEA CM versus 100nM DHEA, and 1μM DHEA CM versus 1μM DHEA resulted in signifi- cantly more AR signaling activation at 12, 24, 36, and 48hours. Continued differences were detected in the LNCaP cell line at 72hours. In the C4-2B cell line, 100nM DHEA treatment at 72hours resulted in even greater AR signaling activation compared with the 100nM DHEA CM group. At 1μM DHEA CM compared with 1μM DHEA treatment, the degree of AR signaling activation was similar. EnzalutamideblocksprostatecancerARsignalinginduced byosteoblast-generatedandrogen Enzalutamide is an effective and specific androgen antagonist thatblocksthreeARactivationsteps:androgenbinding toAR, translocationoftheandrogen-ARcomplexto thenucleus, and the assocation of the androgen-AR complex to AREs.(34) To demonstrate the specificity of DHEA-treated osteoblast CM acting through AR signaling, the ability of enzalutamide to block AR signaling was tested. C4-2B prostate cancer cells were transduced with the tat3-GLuc/DsRed lentivirus combi- nation and treated with and without 1μM enzalutamide daily, as well as 100nM DHEA CM (Fig. 7A), 1μM DHEA CM (Fig. 7B), or ethanol vehicle control. Enzalutamide significantly blocked AR signaling of cells treated with 100nM DHEA CM and 1μM DHEA CM at 48 and 72hours. These data indicate specific AR signaling activation of prostate cancer cells by osteoblast-generated androgens. n OSTEOBLASTSGENERATETESTOSTERONE 1573Fig8.

As bone metastasis progresses, the contribution of prostate cancer–generated androgenswouldthendependnotonlyoncellnumbersbutalso on the capacity of these prostate cancer cells to generate androgens. Toinvestigatehowosteoblast-generatedandrogenscontrib- utetoprostatecancerARsignalingandgrowth,astrategywas selected in which CM from osteoblasts after DHEA treatment wascomparedwiththedirecttreatmentofDHEA.Sinceosteo- blastsdidnotcompletelymetabolizeallDHEA,andandrostene- diolandandrostenedioneintermediateswerealsopresentinthe CM,thesesubstrateslikelycontributedtotheintratumoralgen- eration of androgens by prostate cancer cells. However, since enzymaticconversionofthesesubstratesbytheprostatecancer cellstakestime,thegreaterincreaseinARsignalingwiththeCM at the earlier time points is due to osteoblast-generated testosterone. Althoughosteoblast-generatedandrogens,asreportedhere, likely contribute to prostate cancer expansion in bone, other mechanisms ofprostatecancerregulationbyosteoblasts have beenreported.Inonereport,co-culturewiththepre-osteoblast cell line MC3T3 accentuated the DHT-regulated increase in MDA-PCa-2bprostatecancercellnumbers.(42)CMfromMC3T3 cellsalsoincreasedtheexpressionofARandthesteroidogenesis enzymes HSD3B1, AKR1C3, and SRD5A1 in the CRPC cell line LNCaP-19, leading to an increase in intratumoral androgen n 1576 MOONETAL. productionandapossibleincreaseinARsensitivity.(43)Further- more, the CM of human primary osteoblast cultures was reported to increase PSA production of LNCaP cells in the absenceofsteroidtreatment.Althoughasimilarresultwasnot foundinthedatapresentedhere,thismaysuggestdifferences betweenhumanandmouseprimaryosteoblastcultures.(44) TheLNCaPandC4-2Bprostatecancercellswereselectedfor further study because of the responsiveness to osteoblast- generatedandrogens.Theywerealsoselectedfortheirdissimi- larities in androgen production. Although LNCaP cells had a comparableabilitytogeneratetestosteroneasosteoblasts,the generationoftestosteronedidnotkeeppacewithtestosterone presentintheosteoblastCM.TheLNCaPprostatecancercellline demonstratedgreaterARsignaling,PSAsecretion,andcellnum- bers with DHEA CM treatments compared with DHEA added directlytotheculturemedia.C4-2Bcells,however,displayeddif- ferentkineticstoosteoblastCM.Atearliertimepointsandwith the100nMCMtreatment,therewasatrendforgreaterARsig- naling, PSA production, and cell growth. However, C4-2B AR signalingactivationatlatertimepointsandatthehigher1μM DHEAdirecttreatmentoutpacedtheandrogenpresentinosteo- blast CM. This was likely because of the robust conversion of DHEA to testosteroneandespecially DHTinthis cell line.Both celllinesdemonstratedarapidincreaseinPSAproductionwith the DHEA CM treatments since PSA is a robust, early indicator of AR activation, as previously reported.(45,46) In contrast, the increaseincellnumberswiththeDHEACMtreatmentsisacon- firmatorybutslowersignofandrogenaction.(47,48) The effects of DHEA and R1881 on AR signaling were also investigated in osteoblasts. Despite osteoblasts generating T fromDHEA,ARsignalingwasnotincreasedcomparedwithvehi- clecontrol.AlthoughtheconcentrationofTwassufficientforAR binding,theabsenceofDHTintheCMofDHEA-treatedosteo- blastswasapossiblecontributor.Osteoblastslacktheexpression ofSrd5a2thatencodesanenzymewithanaffinityforTthatis 14 to 20 times greater than the enzyme encoded by Srdr5a1.(49,50) The kinetics of the enzyme encoded by Srd5a3 areunknown.R1881didincreaseARsignalingmodestlyabove thevehiclecontrol.Thesedataindicatethatthemurineosteo- blasts harvested from the ends of long bones, specifically the epiphysealandmetaphysealregions,arenothighlysensitiveto androgens, despite AR expression. Although osteoblasts have beenreportedtobetargetsofandrogens,(42)thisisnottruewith osteoblastsinallskeletalcompartments.Theskeletalphenotype ofosteoblast-targetedgeneticdeletionofArhasbeenreported by a number of groups.(51–54) The consensus among these reportsisthattrabecularbonebutnotcorticalboneosteoblasts aresensitivetoARactionsinbothsexes.Becauseatleastapartial responsetoR1881wasdetected,itislikelythattheosteoblasts harvestedandreportedhereareamixtureofcorticalandtrabec- ularosteoblasts.

However, most of these mice, whenmaintainedonvitaminandbileacidsupplements,hada normal life span.(55) Mutations in human HSD3B7 cause JournalofBoneandMineralResearchcongenital defects in bile acid synthesis.(56,57) While HSD3B1, another 3βHSD isoenzyme gene, participates in the resistance toandrogen-deprivationtherapyinprostatecancerpatients,(36) aroleforHSD3B7inprostatecancerortheskeletonhasnotbeen reported. Duringtheinitialinvasionofprostatecancercellstobone,the osteoblast may be the principal source of androgens.

Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the most potent circulating androgenandissynthesizedfromTbyperipheraltissues,with an affinity for the androgen receptor (AR) two to three times greater than T.(18) DHEA conversion to DHT requires three ste- roidogenic enzymes: 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD),17β-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase(17βHSD),andste- roid 5α-reductase (SRD5α) (Fig. 1). Seven mouse and 3 human 3βHSD, atleast14 17βHSD(that includesproteinsencoded by AKR1C3 in humans, Akr1c6 in mice, RDH5, and RDH11), and 3 SRD5α steroidogenic isoforms have been discovered, each with unique tissue expression patterns.

ConditionedmediaofosteoblaststreatedwithDHEA activateprostatecancerARsignaling The capacity for osteoblast-generated T to activate AR signaling in prostate cancer cells was next tested. Since the androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells also synthesize JournalofBoneandMineralResearch androgens from DHEA, the contributions of each cell type to generate androgens were determined. Residual T already pre- sent in osteoblast conditioned media(CM) would immediately activateprostatecancerARsignaling,whereasDHEAmustfirst beconvertedtoTorDHTinprostatecancercellsbeforeARsig- nalingwouldcommence. The prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and C4-2B were trans- duced with a lentivirus AR-reporter construct (tat3-GLuc) con- taining three AREs fused to a basal promoter and Gaussia luciferase (GLuc).(31) GLuc is a secreted protein that allows for easy collection of media over time as a measure of androgen receptorsignalingactivation.Thecellswerealsotransducedwith a lentivirus constitutively expressing DsRed, with fluorescence used to normalize GLuc values to relative cell number. The androgenanalogR1881robustlyincreasedGLucactivityinboth LNCaP and C4-2B prostate cancer cell lines (Supplemental Fig.S3).TheabilityofosteoblastCMtoactivateprostatecancer ARsignalingwasnextexamined(Fig.5).CMwascollectedfrom murine long-bone osteoblasts 72hours after treatment with 100nM and 1μM DHEA, or an ethanol vehicle control. More immediateincreasesinGLucwereexpectedfromTalreadypre- sentinDHEA-treatedosteoblastCMcomparedwithdirectDHEA treatmentoftheprostatecancercells.Afterprostatecancercells were transduced with the tat3-Gluc/DsRed lentivirus combina- tion, the media were replaced with 50% of the respective prostate cancer medium and 50% CM from osteoblasts that had been treated with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control. These groups were compared with the pros- tate cancer cells treated directy with 100nM DHEA, 1μM DHEA, or ethanol vehicle control along with 50% osteoblast CM treated with EtOH. As expected, the groups treated with ethanol vehicle CM or ethanol vehicle directly did not show AR signaling activation (Fig. 6). In both LNCaP and C4-2B cell lines, treatment with 100nM DHEA CM versus 100nM DHEA, and 1μM DHEA CM versus 1μM DHEA resulted in signifi- cantly more AR signaling activation at 12, 24, 36, and 48hours. Continued differences were detected in the LNCaP cell line at 72hours. In the C4-2B cell line, 100nM DHEA treatment at 72hours resulted in even greater AR signaling activation compared with the 100nM DHEA CM group. At 1μM DHEA CM compared with 1μM DHEA treatment, the degree of AR signaling activation was similar. EnzalutamideblocksprostatecancerARsignalinginduced byosteoblast-generatedandrogen Enzalutamide is an effective and specific androgen antagonist thatblocksthreeARactivationsteps:androgenbinding toAR, translocationoftheandrogen-ARcomplexto thenucleus, and the assocation of the androgen-AR complex to AREs.(34) To demonstrate the specificity of DHEA-treated osteoblast CM acting through AR signaling, the ability of enzalutamide to block AR signaling was tested. C4-2B prostate cancer cells were transduced with the tat3-GLuc/DsRed lentivirus combi- nation and treated with and without 1μM enzalutamide daily, as well as 100nM DHEA CM (Fig. 7A), 1μM DHEA CM (Fig. 7B), or ethanol vehicle control. Enzalutamide significantly blocked AR signaling of cells treated with 100nM DHEA CM and 1μM DHEA CM at 48 and 72hours. These data indicate specific AR signaling activation of prostate cancer cells by osteoblast-generated androgens. n OSTEOBLASTSGENERATETESTOSTERONE 1573Fig8.

As bone metastasis progresses, the contribution of prostate cancer–generated androgenswouldthendependnotonlyoncellnumbersbutalso on the capacity of these prostate cancer cells to generate androgens. Toinvestigatehowosteoblast-generatedandrogenscontrib- utetoprostatecancerARsignalingandgrowth,astrategywas selected in which CM from osteoblasts after DHEA treatment wascomparedwiththedirecttreatmentofDHEA.Sinceosteo- blastsdidnotcompletelymetabolizeallDHEA,andandrostene- diolandandrostenedioneintermediateswerealsopresentinthe CM,thesesubstrateslikelycontributedtotheintratumoralgen- eration of androgens by prostate cancer cells. However, since enzymaticconversionofthesesubstratesbytheprostatecancer cellstakestime,thegreaterincreaseinARsignalingwiththeCM at the earlier time points is due to osteoblast-generated testosterone. Althoughosteoblast-generatedandrogens,asreportedhere, likely contribute to prostate cancer expansion in bone, other mechanisms ofprostatecancerregulationbyosteoblasts have beenreported.Inonereport,co-culturewiththepre-osteoblast cell line MC3T3 accentuated the DHT-regulated increase in MDA-PCa-2bprostatecancercellnumbers.(42)CMfromMC3T3 cellsalsoincreasedtheexpressionofARandthesteroidogenesis enzymes HSD3B1, AKR1C3, and SRD5A1 in the CRPC cell line LNCaP-19, leading to an increase in intratumoral androgen n 1576 MOONETAL. productionandapossibleincreaseinARsensitivity.(43)Further- more, the CM of human primary osteoblast cultures was reported to increase PSA production of LNCaP cells in the absenceofsteroidtreatment.Althoughasimilarresultwasnot foundinthedatapresentedhere,thismaysuggestdifferences betweenhumanandmouseprimaryosteoblastcultures.(44) TheLNCaPandC4-2Bprostatecancercellswereselectedfor further study because of the responsiveness to osteoblast- generatedandrogens.Theywerealsoselectedfortheirdissimi- larities in androgen production. Although LNCaP cells had a comparableabilitytogeneratetestosteroneasosteoblasts,the generationoftestosteronedidnotkeeppacewithtestosterone presentintheosteoblastCM.TheLNCaPprostatecancercellline demonstratedgreaterARsignaling,PSAsecretion,andcellnum- bers with DHEA CM treatments compared with DHEA added directlytotheculturemedia.C4-2Bcells,however,displayeddif- ferentkineticstoosteoblastCM.Atearliertimepointsandwith the100nMCMtreatment,therewasatrendforgreaterARsig- naling, PSA production, and cell growth. However, C4-2B AR signalingactivationatlatertimepointsandatthehigher1μM DHEAdirecttreatmentoutpacedtheandrogenpresentinosteo- blast CM. This was likely because of the robust conversion of DHEA to testosteroneandespecially DHTinthis cell line.Both celllinesdemonstratedarapidincreaseinPSAproductionwith the DHEA CM treatments since PSA is a robust, early indicator of AR activation, as previously reported.(45,46) In contrast, the increaseincellnumberswiththeDHEACMtreatmentsisacon- firmatorybutslowersignofandrogenaction.(47,48) The effects of DHEA and R1881 on AR signaling were also investigated in osteoblasts. Despite osteoblasts generating T fromDHEA,ARsignalingwasnotincreasedcomparedwithvehi- clecontrol.AlthoughtheconcentrationofTwassufficientforAR binding,theabsenceofDHTintheCMofDHEA-treatedosteo- blastswasapossiblecontributor.Osteoblastslacktheexpression ofSrd5a2thatencodesanenzymewithanaffinityforTthatis 14 to 20 times greater than the enzyme encoded by Srdr5a1.(49,50) The kinetics of the enzyme encoded by Srd5a3 areunknown.R1881didincreaseARsignalingmodestlyabove thevehiclecontrol.Thesedataindicatethatthemurineosteo- blasts harvested from the ends of long bones, specifically the epiphysealandmetaphysealregions,arenothighlysensitiveto androgens, despite AR expression. Although osteoblasts have beenreportedtobetargetsofandrogens,(42)thisisnottruewith osteoblastsinallskeletalcompartments.Theskeletalphenotype ofosteoblast-targetedgeneticdeletionofArhasbeenreported by a number of groups.(51–54) The consensus among these reportsisthattrabecularbonebutnotcorticalboneosteoblasts aresensitivetoARactionsinbothsexes.Becauseatleastapartial responsetoR1881wasdetected,itislikelythattheosteoblasts harvestedandreportedhereareamixtureofcorticalandtrabec- ularosteoblasts.

This hypothesis has not been directly tested because clinical trials have not been designed to address this question. The pivotal clinicaltrialsevaluatingtheandrogensynthesisinhibitorabira- teroneacetateandtheandrogenreceptorantagonistenzaluta- mide reported an increase in overall survival and clinical progression-free survival when combined with ADT and com- paredwithADTaloneinpatientswithmetastaticprostatecancer, mostofwhomhadbonemetastasis.(58–60)However,thesestud- iescombinedtheradiographicprogressionofbonemetastasis withothercriteriaforprogression,suchassymptomaticskeletal events and progression of soft-tissue tumors. Data reporting solelyradiographicprogressionofbonemetastasesareunavail- able. The results of these clinical trials do not illuminate the extenttowhichosteoblast-generatedandrogenspromotebone metastasis.Althoughaseparateclinicalstudyreportedthatabir- ateroneacetatereducedandrogenconcentrationsinbonemar- rowcollectedfrommenwithprostatecancerbonemetastases, theindividualcontributionsoftheprostatecancercellsandoste- oblaststoandrogenproductionremainunclear.(61) Although estrogens contribute to prostate cancer pro- gression,(62)neitherexpressionoftheCyp19a1genethatencodes foraromatasenorestradiolinCMwasdetectedinmurineosteo- blasts. A small amount of CYP19A1 was reported in human iliac bonebiopsysamples.(32)Thesehumansampleswerenotapure osteoblastpopulation,andothercelltypeswerelikelypresentthat includedbonemarrowadipocytesthatexpressCYP19A1.(63) Thisreportalsohasimplicationsforskeletaldevelopmentdur- ing adrenarche. Adrenarche commences between the ages of 5and8yearsingirlsandboysandistheperiodwhentheadrenal zonareticularisinitiatessecretionofDHEAand11-oxygenatedC 19 steroids.(64,65)SelecttissuesconvertadrenalDHEA to androgens, including the pubic hair follicles, sweat glands, and the liver. Whilesignificanteffectsofandrogensontheskeletonoccurdur- ing puberty, bone maturation begins during adrenarche before the onset of puberty despite the lack of adequate gonadal T production,(66–68) possibly due to the intracrine generation of sex steroids from adrenal-derived precursors. Although circulat- ing adrenal 11-ketotestosterone and other androgens are responsible for the androgenic manifestations of normal and prematureadrenarche,(69)theosteoblastmaybecentraltolocal generationofskeletalandrogensandsubsequentconversionto sexsteroidsfromDHEAbeforethestartofpuberty.Localgener- ationofandrogensandestrogensmayalsoserveasaprotective mechanismtomitigatebonelossduringmaleandfemalehypo- gonadism. At the cellular level, T increases osteoblast prolifera- tion andosteocyte function.(53,54,70) We now propose a novel model in which the osteoblast receivesadrenal precursorsteroidsand metabolizestheseinto androgenicprostatecancergrowthfactors.Thismodelimplies that targeting osteoblast steroidogenic enzymes might be an effectivetreatmentforprostatecancerbonemetastases.

He has not only been one of the most influential teachers I had, but we also share a common hobby: minerals. So, what could be more suitable than a paper on the combination of chemistry and minerals? Garnets are a super group of minerals with the common formula M(II) M(III) [SiO ] , where M(II) are bivalent met- 3 2 4 3 als and M(III) are trivalent metals. They are further divided into ugrandites and pyralspites. Ugrandites have calcium in the M(II) position and either chromium (uwarowite), alu- minum (grossular), or iron (andradite) in the M(III) position and pyralyspites all have aluminum in their M(III) position and magnesium (pyrope), iron (almandine), or manganese * Clemens Schwarzinger clemens.schwarzinger@jku.at 1 Institute of Chemical Technology of Organic Materials, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria rigin by chemical fingerprinting 29 April 2019 the world and their prices vary depending on the location they was assembled and their chemical composition analyzed with y.

Additionally, garnets can form all kinds of solid mixtures and thus are often hard to classify [1]. Even more complex is the nomenclature of the gem trade. Here, often color or provenance is used to create names as they might sound more valuable to a customer, e.g., tsavorite for green grossular found in Eastern Africa or Malaya—meaning off color—garnets. In this paper we will focus on the species andradite, which when of green color is called demantoid (Fig. 1). The name is derived from diamond and means diamond-like, which is due to the fact that demantoids, when properly cut, have an equal sparkle and play of color as diamonds. This is due to the rather high refractive index of 1.88 and the very high dispersion of 0.057, which is even higher than that of diamond (0.044). Therefore, and because demantoids are much rarer than diamonds, they are highly priced [2]. Another factor that influences the price of gemstones is their provenance. While two gems might look similar in terms of color, cut, and clarity, their price can differ by several hundred percent if one can be assigned to a specific mine or at least a country, the best examples being sapphires Vol.:(0112 33456789)9 08 Fig. 1 Demantoid gemstones from Namibia (front row) and Russia (back row, from left to right: Bashenovskoe, Bobrovka/ Tagil, Ufaley) from Kashmir or rubies from Mogok, Myanmar. For deman- toids, it is Russian origin that increases the value. Tradition- ally, these provenances are assigned by gemmologists based on inclusions and experience and thus are often called expert opinions—which means that two experts might assign two different origins for one gemstone. Demantoids were originally found in the middle of the nineteenth century in the Ural Mountains of Russia [3, 4]: more exactly, in alluvial deposits in the River Bobrovka near the village Elizavetinskoye, close to Niznij Tagil, about 100 km north of Ekaterinburg. Later on other deposits were found in the Ural, roughly 90 km south of Ekaterin- burg, which are Poldnevskoye (Poldnevaya), Karkodin, and Ufaley. The Poldnevskoye deposit is also located on River Bobrovka, but not the same as the one where the original finds were made, which makes correct assignment of the localities sometimes impossible. In the 1990s a new deposit was found in Namibia in the Erongo Mountains close to Tubussis [5–7]. Unlike the Rus- sian stones, they are formed in skarns with no to very little chromium content. The cause of the green color is assumed to be an iron-based chromophore. In its heydays the Green Dragon mine produced five to ten thousand carats per year, with mostly stones between 2 and 3 mm, although very seldom cut stones of over 5 ct were produced. In 2008/09, another deposit was discovered in the mangrove swamps of Antetezambato in Northern Madagascar providing excel- lent crystals which resemble the Namibian material in their appearance [8]. Besides those major deposits, many other places have yielded demantoids such as Iran, Pakistan, Italy, or Canada, but mostly not in qualities or quantities to be of commercial importance. A current (February 2019) market analysis at the world’s largest gem shows in Tucson, USA, has shown that about 60–70% of all demantoids for sale are from Russia and around 25–30% from Namibia. Madagascan gems are very rare as there seems to be no production at the 1 3 C. Schwarzinger moment and only one set of demantoids from Iran was for sale, as well as two stones from Canada. In this paper, we will show that by using trace element analysis it is possible to differentiate between the most important countries of origin and even further in some cases between individual deposits. Results and discussion To be able to differentiate Russian stones from others, it is necessary to analyze and understand their chemistry first. We were able to obtain samples from all mentioned Russian localities, from Ufaley and Karkodin heated and unheated samples were available (heating of stones from these two localities is often necessary to remove the yellow tint and improve the green color) (Fig. 2) [9]. A special case com- prises the demantoids from Ufaley which are found as brown to red (heating to green) or bicolor brown-green crystals. One of these color zoned samples has been sliced and its chemical composition was measured from the brown core via the intense green middle part to the yellowish-green rim to reveal the different concentrations of minor elements within a single crystal. XPS analysis confirmed the crystal to be almost pure andradite with no significant variations of the Ca, Fe, Si, and O concentrations. Figure 3 shows that the concentration of titanium is highest in the brown core and gradually fades toward the outer part of the crys- tal. The intense green medium section, which is of highest commercial value, is dominated by chromium. Vanadium, which is very often also a reason of green color in minerals and sometimes even of more influence than chromium [10], does not seem to play an important role in the coloration of these garnets. In a first attempt to assign correct origins, all Russian and Namibian stones were analyzed and trends within theDetermination of demantoid garnet origin by chemical fingerprinting Fig. 2 Rough demantoid samples from Russian localities. Left to right: Ufaley 1 (heated), Ufaley 1 (unheated), Ufaley 2 (unheated), Ufaley 2 (heated), Karkodin (unheated), Karko- din (heated), Poldnevaya (unheated), Bobrovka/Tagil (unheated) Fig. 3 Distribution of trace elements along a crystal section (from center to rim) showing high titanium concentrations in the center and highest chro- mium concentrations in the green sections chemical composition traced. It could soon be seen that most of the Russian stones have concentrations of Cr and V (green chromophores) in the range of 100–10000 ppm, whereas Namibian stones rarely have those elements at all. On the other hand, Mn could be found in Namibian stones in the range of 1–2%, whereas in the Russian stones it was only present below 500 ppm. After some optimization, it was found that using the sum of V and Cr as well as the Mn/Ti ratio as criteria, a very good separation of the 42 Russian and 23 Namibian stones is possible (Fig. 4a). Both values are plotted on logarithmic scales separating the localities well with only a narrow zone of uncertainty. Also, the results obtained from the multicolored Ufaley sample are displayed using this plot and, although they spread along the Mn/Ti axis (Fig. 4b), a clear separation from the Namibian material is possible. The only Russian stones that cannot be sepa- rated are those from Bashenovskoe, but those are first of all rarities and not used commercially and can be distinguished from other demantoids as they typically have some percent- age of grossular [personal communication Ildar Latypov]. Having a closer look at the Russian localities, it could be found that using the Al/Mg ratio in combination with the Mn/Ti ratio even an identification of some individual mines is possible (Fig. 5). The Ufaley material has the highest Al/ Mg ratios and the Bashenovskoe material the highest Mn/ 909 Ti ratios, similar to the Namibian material. The deposits of Karkodin and Poldnevskoye are separated only by a few kilometers and therefore do not separate well in this diagram but form a group together. This group is only disturbed by a few spots assigned to the locality Bobrovka, which as stated in the introduction is either a river close to Elizavetinskoye where the original find was made or a river close to the Pol- dnevskoye deposit—so it is assumed that those samples are from the latter location. All other samples labeled Bobrovka or Russia are rather widespread in this plot, but show tenta- tively a lower Al/Mg ratio. One of the reasons for this can be that at the River Bobrovka alluvial deposits have been mined, which means that the stones were not found in the spot where they originally formed, but were washed out by the river and transported along with gravel. It is possible that they originate from more than one primary deposit, thus explaining the rather broad chemical distribution. The third commercially important location at the moment is Madagascar. The andradites from Antetezambato are formed in a geologically rather similar surrounding as in Namibia (skarn deposits) and also optically are more like their Namibian than their Russian counterparts. When using the Mn/Ti versus sum of Cr and V approach, the stones from Madagascar are easily separated from the ones from Namibia by their very low Mn/Ti ratio, but due to the fact 1 39 10 Fig. 4 a Separation of Russian and Namibian demantoids using trace a plot of manganese/titanium ratio vs. the sum of chromium and vanadium.

A very effective way to differentiate stones from Mada- gascar is by looking at their Al content. Namibian stones typically have way below 1000 ppm and Russian stones, although having a higher content of mostly up to 2000 ppm, with Ufaley stones being an exception with 1500–6500 ppm, are clearly lower in Al than the Madagascar samples.

Material from Madagascar typically has an even lower Mn/Ti ratio, but might have some Cr and especially V; however, due to their extremely high Al content, they can also be easily separated from all other sources. What is absolutely necessary for such a model to work is that a significant number of reference samples with proven origin must be available and that the database is always kept up to date as new deposits are still being found. Some rari- ties might not be assigned correctly by the approach pre- sented here, as not all locations have been included yet into the study but the focus at this time has been the identification of those gems that are currently dominating on the market. Materials and methods Rough demantoid samples were collected from Tubussis (Namibia), Ufaley (Russia), Karkodin (Russia), Poldnevs- koye (Russia), Bobrovka (Russia), Bashenovskoe (Russia), and Antetezambato (Madagascar). Cut stones were either cut by the author or taken from the collection of the Aus- trian Gemmological Society or the collection of Gerhard Brandstetter. Many of the cut stones were only labeled “Rus- sia” with no details of the mine. A total of 42 Russian (126 points), 23 Namibian (69 points), 2 Madagascar (14 points), and 1 multicolored sample from Ufaley Russia (59 points) were analyzed. All samples were tested with Raman and FTIR spectros- copy to ensure that they were all andradites [11]. Chemical analysis was done by laser ablation–icp MS. Concentrations of Mg, Al, Ti, V, Cr, and Mn were measured by laser abla- tion–inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA–icp 911 MS) using a Cetac LSX-213 G2 + laser ablation system coupled to a Thermo Fisher Scientific X-Series II icp MS system. Ca, Si, and Fe were also monitored to ensure the smoothness of the laser ablation process. Tuning and calibra- tion were carried out using NIST 610, 612, and 614 glass standards; reference values were taken from Jochum et al. [12]. The laser ablation was operated with a 100 µm spot size, a laser energy of 10% and a repetition rate of 10 Hz. 130 shots were made on each spot and the ablated products transferred to the icp MS with a flow rate of 500 cm3 m in−1 He gas. Each sample was measured at three different spots. Infrared spectra were collected with a Thermo Scientific iN10MX FTIR microscope in reflection mode using a liquid nitrogen cooled MCT detector. Spectra were collected from 680 to 4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 8 cm−1 and 16 scans were averaged for one spectrum. Raman spectra were col- lected with a Thermo Scientific DXR Raman microscope using a 780 nm laser. Spectra were recorded from 55 to 3400 cm−1 and automatically summarized until a signal to noise level of 500 was achieved. XPS measurements were performed using a Thermo Scientific Thetaprobe device, which was equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hη = 1486.6 eV) and dual flood gun for the surface charge neutralization. The X-ray spot on the measured sample surface was 400 µm in diameter. The survey spectra were recorded using a pass energy of 200 eV and an energy step width of 1 eV.

He has not only been one of the most influential teachers I had, but we also share a common hobby: minerals. So, what could be more suitable than a paper on the combination of chemistry and minerals? Garnets are a super group of minerals with the common formula M(II) M(III) [SiO ] , where M(II) are bivalent met- 3 2 4 3 als and M(III) are trivalent metals. They are further divided into ugrandites and pyralspites. Ugrandites have calcium in the M(II) position and either chromium (uwarowite), alu- minum (grossular), or iron (andradite) in the M(III) position and pyralyspites all have aluminum in their M(III) position and magnesium (pyrope), iron (almandine), or manganese * Clemens Schwarzinger clemens.schwarzinger@jku.at 1 Institute of Chemical Technology of Organic Materials, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria rigin by chemical fingerprinting 29 April 2019 the world and their prices vary depending on the location they was assembled and their chemical composition analyzed with y.

Additionally, garnets can form all kinds of solid mixtures and thus are often hard to classify [1]. Even more complex is the nomenclature of the gem trade. Here, often color or provenance is used to create names as they might sound more valuable to a customer, e.g., tsavorite for green grossular found in Eastern Africa or Malaya—meaning off color—garnets. In this paper we will focus on the species andradite, which when of green color is called demantoid (Fig. 1). The name is derived from diamond and means diamond-like, which is due to the fact that demantoids, when properly cut, have an equal sparkle and play of color as diamonds. This is due to the rather high refractive index of 1.88 and the very high dispersion of 0.057, which is even higher than that of diamond (0.044). Therefore, and because demantoids are much rarer than diamonds, they are highly priced [2]. Another factor that influences the price of gemstones is their provenance. While two gems might look similar in terms of color, cut, and clarity, their price can differ by several hundred percent if one can be assigned to a specific mine or at least a country, the best examples being sapphires Vol.:(0112 33456789)9 08 Fig. 1 Demantoid gemstones from Namibia (front row) and Russia (back row, from left to right: Bashenovskoe, Bobrovka/ Tagil, Ufaley) from Kashmir or rubies from Mogok, Myanmar. For deman- toids, it is Russian origin that increases the value. Tradition- ally, these provenances are assigned by gemmologists based on inclusions and experience and thus are often called expert opinions—which means that two experts might assign two different origins for one gemstone. Demantoids were originally found in the middle of the nineteenth century in the Ural Mountains of Russia [3, 4]: more exactly, in alluvial deposits in the River Bobrovka near the village Elizavetinskoye, close to Niznij Tagil, about 100 km north of Ekaterinburg. Later on other deposits were found in the Ural, roughly 90 km south of Ekaterin- burg, which are Poldnevskoye (Poldnevaya), Karkodin, and Ufaley. The Poldnevskoye deposit is also located on River Bobrovka, but not the same as the one where the original finds were made, which makes correct assignment of the localities sometimes impossible. In the 1990s a new deposit was found in Namibia in the Erongo Mountains close to Tubussis [5–7]. Unlike the Rus- sian stones, they are formed in skarns with no to very little chromium content. The cause of the green color is assumed to be an iron-based chromophore. In its heydays the Green Dragon mine produced five to ten thousand carats per year, with mostly stones between 2 and 3 mm, although very seldom cut stones of over 5 ct were produced. In 2008/09, another deposit was discovered in the mangrove swamps of Antetezambato in Northern Madagascar providing excel- lent crystals which resemble the Namibian material in their appearance [8]. Besides those major deposits, many other places have yielded demantoids such as Iran, Pakistan, Italy, or Canada, but mostly not in qualities or quantities to be of commercial importance. A current (February 2019) market analysis at the world’s largest gem shows in Tucson, USA, has shown that about 60–70% of all demantoids for sale are from Russia and around 25–30% from Namibia. Madagascan gems are very rare as there seems to be no production at the 1 3 C. Schwarzinger moment and only one set of demantoids from Iran was for sale, as well as two stones from Canada. In this paper, we will show that by using trace element analysis it is possible to differentiate between the most important countries of origin and even further in some cases between individual deposits. Results and discussion To be able to differentiate Russian stones from others, it is necessary to analyze and understand their chemistry first. We were able to obtain samples from all mentioned Russian localities, from Ufaley and Karkodin heated and unheated samples were available (heating of stones from these two localities is often necessary to remove the yellow tint and improve the green color) (Fig. 2) [9]. A special case com- prises the demantoids from Ufaley which are found as brown to red (heating to green) or bicolor brown-green crystals. One of these color zoned samples has been sliced and its chemical composition was measured from the brown core via the intense green middle part to the yellowish-green rim to reveal the different concentrations of minor elements within a single crystal. XPS analysis confirmed the crystal to be almost pure andradite with no significant variations of the Ca, Fe, Si, and O concentrations. Figure 3 shows that the concentration of titanium is highest in the brown core and gradually fades toward the outer part of the crys- tal. The intense green medium section, which is of highest commercial value, is dominated by chromium. Vanadium, which is very often also a reason of green color in minerals and sometimes even of more influence than chromium [10], does not seem to play an important role in the coloration of these garnets. In a first attempt to assign correct origins, all Russian and Namibian stones were analyzed and trends within theDetermination of demantoid garnet origin by chemical fingerprinting Fig. 2 Rough demantoid samples from Russian localities. Left to right: Ufaley 1 (heated), Ufaley 1 (unheated), Ufaley 2 (unheated), Ufaley 2 (heated), Karkodin (unheated), Karko- din (heated), Poldnevaya (unheated), Bobrovka/Tagil (unheated) Fig. 3 Distribution of trace elements along a crystal section (from center to rim) showing high titanium concentrations in the center and highest chro- mium concentrations in the green sections chemical composition traced. It could soon be seen that most of the Russian stones have concentrations of Cr and V (green chromophores) in the range of 100–10000 ppm, whereas Namibian stones rarely have those elements at all. On the other hand, Mn could be found in Namibian stones in the range of 1–2%, whereas in the Russian stones it was only present below 500 ppm. After some optimization, it was found that using the sum of V and Cr as well as the Mn/Ti ratio as criteria, a very good separation of the 42 Russian and 23 Namibian stones is possible (Fig. 4a). Both values are plotted on logarithmic scales separating the localities well with only a narrow zone of uncertainty. Also, the results obtained from the multicolored Ufaley sample are displayed using this plot and, although they spread along the Mn/Ti axis (Fig. 4b), a clear separation from the Namibian material is possible. The only Russian stones that cannot be sepa- rated are those from Bashenovskoe, but those are first of all rarities and not used commercially and can be distinguished from other demantoids as they typically have some percent- age of grossular [personal communication Ildar Latypov]. Having a closer look at the Russian localities, it could be found that using the Al/Mg ratio in combination with the Mn/Ti ratio even an identification of some individual mines is possible (Fig. 5). The Ufaley material has the highest Al/ Mg ratios and the Bashenovskoe material the highest Mn/ 909 Ti ratios, similar to the Namibian material. The deposits of Karkodin and Poldnevskoye are separated only by a few kilometers and therefore do not separate well in this diagram but form a group together. This group is only disturbed by a few spots assigned to the locality Bobrovka, which as stated in the introduction is either a river close to Elizavetinskoye where the original find was made or a river close to the Pol- dnevskoye deposit—so it is assumed that those samples are from the latter location. All other samples labeled Bobrovka or Russia are rather widespread in this plot, but show tenta- tively a lower Al/Mg ratio. One of the reasons for this can be that at the River Bobrovka alluvial deposits have been mined, which means that the stones were not found in the spot where they originally formed, but were washed out by the river and transported along with gravel. It is possible that they originate from more than one primary deposit, thus explaining the rather broad chemical distribution. The third commercially important location at the moment is Madagascar. The andradites from Antetezambato are formed in a geologically rather similar surrounding as in Namibia (skarn deposits) and also optically are more like their Namibian than their Russian counterparts. When using the Mn/Ti versus sum of Cr and V approach, the stones from Madagascar are easily separated from the ones from Namibia by their very low Mn/Ti ratio, but due to the fact 1 39 10 Fig. 4 a Separation of Russian and Namibian demantoids using trace a plot of manganese/titanium ratio vs. the sum of chromium and vanadium.

Madagascan gems are very rare as there seems to be no production at the 1 3 C. Schwarzinger moment and only one set of demantoids from Iran was for sale, as well as two stones from Canada. In this paper, we will show that by using trace element analysis it is possible to differentiate between the most important countries of origin and even further in some cases between individual deposits. Results and discussion To be able to differentiate Russian stones from others, it is necessary to analyze and understand their chemistry first. We were able to obtain samples from all mentioned Russian localities, from Ufaley and Karkodin heated and unheated samples were available (heating of stones from these two localities is often necessary to remove the yellow tint and improve the green color) (Fig. 2) [9]. A special case com- prises the demantoids from Ufaley which are found as brown to red (heating to green) or bicolor brown-green crystals. One of these color zoned samples has been sliced and its chemical composition was measured from the brown core via the intense green middle part to the yellowish-green rim to reveal the different concentrations of minor elements within a single crystal. XPS analysis confirmed the crystal to be almost pure andradite with no significant variations of the Ca, Fe, Si, and O concentrations. Figure 3 shows that the concentration of titanium is highest in the brown core and gradually fades toward the outer part of the crys- tal. The intense green medium section, which is of highest commercial value, is dominated by chromium. Vanadium, which is very often also a reason of green color in minerals and sometimes even of more influence than chromium [10], does not seem to play an important role in the coloration of these garnets. In a first attempt to assign correct origins, all Russian and Namibian stones were analyzed and trends within theDetermination of demantoid garnet origin by chemical fingerprinting Fig. 2 Rough demantoid samples from Russian localities. Left to right: Ufaley 1 (heated), Ufaley 1 (unheated), Ufaley 2 (unheated), Ufaley 2 (heated), Karkodin (unheated), Karko- din (heated), Poldnevaya (unheated), Bobrovka/Tagil (unheated) Fig. 3 Distribution of trace elements along a crystal section (from center to rim) showing high titanium concentrations in the center and highest chro- mium concentrations in the green sections chemical composition traced. It could soon be seen that most of the Russian stones have concentrations of Cr and V (green chromophores) in the range of 100–10000 ppm, whereas Namibian stones rarely have those elements at all. On the other hand, Mn could be found in Namibian stones in the range of 1–2%, whereas in the Russian stones it was only present below 500 ppm. After some optimization, it was found that using the sum of V and Cr as well as the Mn/Ti ratio as criteria, a very good separation of the 42 Russian and 23 Namibian stones is possible (Fig. 4a). Both values are plotted on logarithmic scales separating the localities well with only a narrow zone of uncertainty. Also, the results obtained from the multicolored Ufaley sample are displayed using this plot and, although they spread along the Mn/Ti axis (Fig. 4b), a clear separation from the Namibian material is possible. The only Russian stones that cannot be sepa- rated are those from Bashenovskoe, but those are first of all rarities and not used commercially and can be distinguished from other demantoids as they typically have some percent- age of grossular [personal communication Ildar Latypov]. Having a closer look at the Russian localities, it could be found that using the Al/Mg ratio in combination with the Mn/Ti ratio even an identification of some individual mines is possible (Fig. 5). The Ufaley material has the highest Al/ Mg ratios and the Bashenovskoe material the highest Mn/ 909 Ti ratios, similar to the Namibian material. The deposits of Karkodin and Poldnevskoye are separated only by a few kilometers and therefore do not separate well in this diagram but form a group together. This group is only disturbed by a few spots assigned to the locality Bobrovka, which as stated in the introduction is either a river close to Elizavetinskoye where the original find was made or a river close to the Pol- dnevskoye deposit—so it is assumed that those samples are from the latter location. All other samples labeled Bobrovka or Russia are rather widespread in this plot, but show tenta- tively a lower Al/Mg ratio. One of the reasons for this can be that at the River Bobrovka alluvial deposits have been mined, which means that the stones were not found in the spot where they originally formed, but were washed out by the river and transported along with gravel. It is possible that they originate from more than one primary deposit, thus explaining the rather broad chemical distribution. The third commercially important location at the moment is Madagascar. The andradites from Antetezambato are formed in a geologically rather similar surrounding as in Namibia (skarn deposits) and also optically are more like their Namibian than their Russian counterparts. When using the Mn/Ti versus sum of Cr and V approach, the stones from Madagascar are easily separated from the ones from Namibia by their very low Mn/Ti ratio, but due to the fact 1 39 10 Fig. 4 a Separation of Russian and Namibian demantoids using trace a plot of manganese/titanium ratio vs. the sum of chromium and vanadium.

A very effective way to differentiate stones from Mada- gascar is by looking at their Al content. Namibian stones typically have way below 1000 ppm and Russian stones, although having a higher content of mostly up to 2000 ppm, with Ufaley stones being an exception with 1500–6500 ppm, are clearly lower in Al than the Madagascar samples. The Al concentration in stones from Madagascar has always been found to be higher than 11000 ppm with maximum values being around 10% (it has to be noted that such concentra- tions are too high to be measured with LA–icp MS and tend 1 3 C.

The famous bright green Russian stones owe their color to a high concentration of Cr and/or V—which is a good indicator—but not all Russian stones have sig- nificantly higher values then other stones. But in combina- tion with low Mn and high Ti concentrations, they can be separated from their Namibian counterparts. Material from Madagascar typically has an even lower Mn/Ti ratio, but might have some Cr and especially V; however, due to their extremely high Al content, they can also be easily separated from all other sources. What is absolutely necessary for such a model to work is that a significant number of reference samples with proven origin must be available and that the database is always kept up to date as new deposits are still being found. Some rari- ties might not be assigned correctly by the approach pre- sented here, as not all locations have been included yet into the study but the focus at this time has been the identification of those gems that are currently dominating on the market. Materials and methods Rough demantoid samples were collected from Tubussis (Namibia), Ufaley (Russia), Karkodin (Russia), Poldnevs- koye (Russia), Bobrovka (Russia), Bashenovskoe (Russia), and Antetezambato (Madagascar). Cut stones were either cut by the author or taken from the collection of the Aus- trian Gemmological Society or the collection of Gerhard Brandstetter. Many of the cut stones were only labeled “Rus- sia” with no details of the mine. A total of 42 Russian (126 points), 23 Namibian (69 points), 2 Madagascar (14 points), and 1 multicolored sample from Ufaley Russia (59 points) were analyzed. All samples were tested with Raman and FTIR spectros- copy to ensure that they were all andradites [11]. Chemical analysis was done by laser ablation–icp MS. Concentrations of Mg, Al, Ti, V, Cr, and Mn were measured by laser abla- tion–inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA–icp 911 MS) using a Cetac LSX-213 G2 + laser ablation system coupled to a Thermo Fisher Scientific X-Series II icp MS system. Ca, Si, and Fe were also monitored to ensure the smoothness of the laser ablation process. Tuning and calibra- tion were carried out using NIST 610, 612, and 614 glass standards; reference values were taken from Jochum et al. [12]. The laser ablation was operated with a 100 µm spot size, a laser energy of 10% and a repetition rate of 10 Hz. 130 shots were made on each spot and the ablated products transferred to the icp MS with a flow rate of 500 cm3 m in−1 He gas. Each sample was measured at three different spots. Infrared spectra were collected with a Thermo Scientific iN10MX FTIR microscope in reflection mode using a liquid nitrogen cooled MCT detector. Spectra were collected from 680 to 4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 8 cm−1 and 16 scans were averaged for one spectrum. Raman spectra were col- lected with a Thermo Scientific DXR Raman microscope using a 780 nm laser. Spectra were recorded from 55 to 3400 cm−1 and automatically summarized until a signal to noise level of 500 was achieved. XPS measurements were performed using a Thermo Scientific Thetaprobe device, which was equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hη = 1486.6 eV) and dual flood gun for the surface charge neutralization. The X-ray spot on the measured sample surface was 400 µm in diameter. The survey spectra were recorded using a pass energy of 200 eV and an energy step width of 1 eV.

He has not only been one of the most influential teachers I had, but we also share a common hobby: minerals. So, what could be more suitable than a paper on the combination of chemistry and minerals? Garnets are a super group of minerals with the common formula M(II) M(III) [SiO ] , where M(II) are bivalent met- 3 2 4 3 als and M(III) are trivalent metals. They are further divided into ugrandites and pyralspites. Ugrandites have calcium in the M(II) position and either chromium (uwarowite), alu- minum (grossular), or iron (andradite) in the M(III) position and pyralyspites all have aluminum in their M(III) position and magnesium (pyrope), iron (almandine), or manganese * Clemens Schwarzinger clemens.schwarzinger@jku.at 1 Institute of Chemical Technology of Organic Materials, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria rigin by chemical fingerprinting 29 April 2019 the world and their prices vary depending on the location they was assembled and their chemical composition analyzed with y.

Additionally, garnets can form all kinds of solid mixtures and thus are often hard to classify [1]. Even more complex is the nomenclature of the gem trade. Here, often color or provenance is used to create names as they might sound more valuable to a customer, e.g., tsavorite for green grossular found in Eastern Africa or Malaya—meaning off color—garnets. In this paper we will focus on the species andradite, which when of green color is called demantoid (Fig. 1). The name is derived from diamond and means diamond-like, which is due to the fact that demantoids, when properly cut, have an equal sparkle and play of color as diamonds. This is due to the rather high refractive index of 1.88 and the very high dispersion of 0.057, which is even higher than that of diamond (0.044). Therefore, and because demantoids are much rarer than diamonds, they are highly priced [2]. Another factor that influences the price of gemstones is their provenance. While two gems might look similar in terms of color, cut, and clarity, their price can differ by several hundred percent if one can be assigned to a specific mine or at least a country, the best examples being sapphires Vol.:(0112 33456789)9 08 Fig. 1 Demantoid gemstones from Namibia (front row) and Russia (back row, from left to right: Bashenovskoe, Bobrovka/ Tagil, Ufaley) from Kashmir or rubies from Mogok, Myanmar. For deman- toids, it is Russian origin that increases the value. Tradition- ally, these provenances are assigned by gemmologists based on inclusions and experience and thus are often called expert opinions—which means that two experts might assign two different origins for one gemstone. Demantoids were originally found in the middle of the nineteenth century in the Ural Mountains of Russia [3, 4]: more exactly, in alluvial deposits in the River Bobrovka near the village Elizavetinskoye, close to Niznij Tagil, about 100 km north of Ekaterinburg. Later on other deposits were found in the Ural, roughly 90 km south of Ekaterin- burg, which are Poldnevskoye (Poldnevaya), Karkodin, and Ufaley. The Poldnevskoye deposit is also located on River Bobrovka, but not the same as the one where the original finds were made, which makes correct assignment of the localities sometimes impossible. In the 1990s a new deposit was found in Namibia in the Erongo Mountains close to Tubussis [5–7]. Unlike the Rus- sian stones, they are formed in skarns with no to very little chromium content. The cause of the green color is assumed to be an iron-based chromophore. In its heydays the Green Dragon mine produced five to ten thousand carats per year, with mostly stones between 2 and 3 mm, although very seldom cut stones of over 5 ct were produced. In 2008/09, another deposit was discovered in the mangrove swamps of Antetezambato in Northern Madagascar providing excel- lent crystals which resemble the Namibian material in their appearance [8]. Besides those major deposits, many other places have yielded demantoids such as Iran, Pakistan, Italy, or Canada, but mostly not in qualities or quantities to be of commercial importance. A current (February 2019) market analysis at the world’s largest gem shows in Tucson, USA, has shown that about 60–70% of all demantoids for sale are from Russia and around 25–30% from Namibia. Madagascan gems are very rare as there seems to be no production at the 1 3 C. Schwarzinger moment and only one set of demantoids from Iran was for sale, as well as two stones from Canada. In this paper, we will show that by using trace element analysis it is possible to differentiate between the most important countries of origin and even further in some cases between individual deposits.

He has not only been one of the most influential teachers I had, but we also share a common hobby: minerals. So, what could be more suitable than a paper on the combination of chemistry and minerals? Garnets are a super group of minerals with the common formula M(II) M(III) [SiO ] , where M(II) are bivalent met- 3 2 4 3 als and M(III) are trivalent metals. They are further divided into ugrandites and pyralspites. Ugrandites have calcium in the M(II) position and either chromium (uwarowite), alu- minum (grossular), or iron (andradite) in the M(III) position and pyralyspites all have aluminum in their M(III) position and magnesium (pyrope), iron (almandine), or manganese * Clemens Schwarzinger clemens.schwarzinger@jku.at 1 Institute of Chemical Technology of Organic Materials, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria rigin by chemical fingerprinting 29 April 2019 the world and their prices vary depending on the location they was assembled and their chemical composition analyzed with y.

Additionally, garnets can form all kinds of solid mixtures and thus are often hard to classify [1]. Even more complex is the nomenclature of the gem trade. Here, often color or provenance is used to create names as they might sound more valuable to a customer, e.g., tsavorite for green grossular found in Eastern Africa or Malaya—meaning off color—garnets. In this paper we will focus on the species andradite, which when of green color is called demantoid (Fig. 1). The name is derived from diamond and means diamond-like, which is due to the fact that demantoids, when properly cut, have an equal sparkle and play of color as diamonds. This is due to the rather high refractive index of 1.88 and the very high dispersion of 0.057, which is even higher than that of diamond (0.044). Therefore, and because demantoids are much rarer than diamonds, they are highly priced [2]. Another factor that influences the price of gemstones is their provenance. While two gems might look similar in terms of color, cut, and clarity, their price can differ by several hundred percent if one can be assigned to a specific mine or at least a country, the best examples being sapphires Vol.:(0112 33456789)9 08 Fig. 1 Demantoid gemstones from Namibia (front row) and Russia (back row, from left to right: Bashenovskoe, Bobrovka/ Tagil, Ufaley) from Kashmir or rubies from Mogok, Myanmar. For deman- toids, it is Russian origin that increases the value. Tradition- ally, these provenances are assigned by gemmologists based on inclusions and experience and thus are often called expert opinions—which means that two experts might assign two different origins for one gemstone. Demantoids were originally found in the middle of the nineteenth century in the Ural Mountains of Russia [3, 4]: more exactly, in alluvial deposits in the River Bobrovka near the village Elizavetinskoye, close to Niznij Tagil, about 100 km north of Ekaterinburg. Later on other deposits were found in the Ural, roughly 90 km south of Ekaterin- burg, which are Poldnevskoye (Poldnevaya), Karkodin, and Ufaley. The Poldnevskoye deposit is also located on River Bobrovka, but not the same as the one where the original finds were made, which makes correct assignment of the localities sometimes impossible. In the 1990s a new deposit was found in Namibia in the Erongo Mountains close to Tubussis [5–7]. Unlike the Rus- sian stones, they are formed in skarns with no to very little chromium content. The cause of the green color is assumed to be an iron-based chromophore. In its heydays the Green Dragon mine produced five to ten thousand carats per year, with mostly stones between 2 and 3 mm, although very seldom cut stones of over 5 ct were produced. In 2008/09, another deposit was discovered in the mangrove swamps of Antetezambato in Northern Madagascar providing excel- lent crystals which resemble the Namibian material in their appearance [8]. Besides those major deposits, many other places have yielded demantoids such as Iran, Pakistan, Italy, or Canada, but mostly not in qualities or quantities to be of commercial importance. A current (February 2019) market analysis at the world’s largest gem shows in Tucson, USA, has shown that about 60–70% of all demantoids for sale are from Russia and around 25–30% from Namibia. Madagascan gems are very rare as there seems to be no production at the 1 3 C. Schwarzinger moment and only one set of demantoids from Iran was for sale, as well as two stones from Canada. In this paper, we will show that by using trace element analysis it is possible to differentiate between the most important countries of origin and even further in some cases between individual deposits. Results and discussion To be able to differentiate Russian stones from others, it is necessary to analyze and understand their chemistry first. We were able to obtain samples from all mentioned Russian localities, from Ufaley and Karkodin heated and unheated samples were available (heating of stones from these two localities is often necessary to remove the yellow tint and improve the green color) (Fig. 2) [9]. A special case com- prises the demantoids from Ufaley which are found as brown to red (heating to green) or bicolor brown-green crystals. One of these color zoned samples has been sliced and its chemical composition was measured from the brown core via the intense green middle part to the yellowish-green rim to reveal the different concentrations of minor elements within a single crystal. XPS analysis confirmed the crystal to be almost pure andradite with no significant variations of the Ca, Fe, Si, and O concentrations. Figure 3 shows that the concentration of titanium is highest in the brown core and gradually fades toward the outer part of the crys- tal. The intense green medium section, which is of highest commercial value, is dominated by chromium. Vanadium, which is very often also a reason of green color in minerals and sometimes even of more influence than chromium [10], does not seem to play an important role in the coloration of these garnets. In a first attempt to assign correct origins, all Russian and Namibian stones were analyzed and trends within theDetermination of demantoid garnet origin by chemical fingerprinting Fig. 2 Rough demantoid samples from Russian localities. Left to right: Ufaley 1 (heated), Ufaley 1 (unheated), Ufaley 2 (unheated), Ufaley 2 (heated), Karkodin (unheated), Karko- din (heated), Poldnevaya (unheated), Bobrovka/Tagil (unheated) Fig. 3 Distribution of trace elements along a crystal section (from center to rim) showing high titanium concentrations in the center and highest chro- mium concentrations in the green sections chemical composition traced. It could soon be seen that most of the Russian stones have concentrations of Cr and V (green chromophores) in the range of 100–10000 ppm, whereas Namibian stones rarely have those elements at all. On the other hand, Mn could be found in Namibian stones in the range of 1–2%, whereas in the Russian stones it was only present below 500 ppm. After some optimization, it was found that using the sum of V and Cr as well as the Mn/Ti ratio as criteria, a very good separation of the 42 Russian and 23 Namibian stones is possible (Fig. 4a). Both values are plotted on logarithmic scales separating the localities well with only a narrow zone of uncertainty. Also, the results obtained from the multicolored Ufaley sample are displayed using this plot and, although they spread along the Mn/Ti axis (Fig. 4b), a clear separation from the Namibian material is possible. The only Russian stones that cannot be sepa- rated are those from Bashenovskoe, but those are first of all rarities and not used commercially and can be distinguished from other demantoids as they typically have some percent- age of grossular [personal communication Ildar Latypov]. Having a closer look at the Russian localities, it could be found that using the Al/Mg ratio in combination with the Mn/Ti ratio even an identification of some individual mines is possible (Fig. 5). The Ufaley material has the highest Al/ Mg ratios and the Bashenovskoe material the highest Mn/ 909 Ti ratios, similar to the Namibian material. The deposits of Karkodin and Poldnevskoye are separated only by a few kilometers and therefore do not separate well in this diagram but form a group together. This group is only disturbed by a few spots assigned to the locality Bobrovka, which as stated in the introduction is either a river close to Elizavetinskoye where the original find was made or a river close to the Pol- dnevskoye deposit—so it is assumed that those samples are from the latter location. All other samples labeled Bobrovka or Russia are rather widespread in this plot, but show tenta- tively a lower Al/Mg ratio. One of the reasons for this can be that at the River Bobrovka alluvial deposits have been mined, which means that the stones were not found in the spot where they originally formed, but were washed out by the river and transported along with gravel. It is possible that they originate from more than one primary deposit, thus explaining the rather broad chemical distribution. The third commercially important location at the moment is Madagascar. The andradites from Antetezambato are formed in a geologically rather similar surrounding as in Namibia (skarn deposits) and also optically are more like their Namibian than their Russian counterparts. When using the Mn/Ti versus sum of Cr and V approach, the stones from Madagascar are easily separated from the ones from Namibia by their very low Mn/Ti ratio, but due to the fact 1 39 10 Fig. 4 a Separation of Russian and Namibian demantoids using trace a plot of manganese/titanium ratio vs. the sum of chromium and vanadium.

A very effective way to differentiate stones from Mada- gascar is by looking at their Al content. Namibian stones typically have way below 1000 ppm and Russian stones, although having a higher content of mostly up to 2000 ppm, with Ufaley stones being an exception with 1500–6500 ppm, are clearly lower in Al than the Madagascar samples. The Al concentration in stones from Madagascar has always been found to be higher than 11000 ppm with maximum values being around 10% (it has to be noted that such concentra- tions are too high to be measured with LA–icp MS and tend 1 3 C.

The famous bright green Russian stones owe their color to a high concentration of Cr and/or V—which is a good indicator—but not all Russian stones have sig- nificantly higher values then other stones. But in combina- tion with low Mn and high Ti concentrations, they can be separated from their Namibian counterparts. Material from Madagascar typically has an even lower Mn/Ti ratio, but might have some Cr and especially V; however, due to their extremely high Al content, they can also be easily separated from all other sources. What is absolutely necessary for such a model to work is that a significant number of reference samples with proven origin must be available and that the database is always kept up to date as new deposits are still being found. Some rari- ties might not be assigned correctly by the approach pre- sented here, as not all locations have been included yet into the study but the focus at this time has been the identification of those gems that are currently dominating on the market. Materials and methods Rough demantoid samples were collected from Tubussis (Namibia), Ufaley (Russia), Karkodin (Russia), Poldnevs- koye (Russia), Bobrovka (Russia), Bashenovskoe (Russia), and Antetezambato (Madagascar). Cut stones were either cut by the author or taken from the collection of the Aus- trian Gemmological Society or the collection of Gerhard Brandstetter. Many of the cut stones were only labeled “Rus- sia” with no details of the mine. A total of 42 Russian (126 points), 23 Namibian (69 points), 2 Madagascar (14 points), and 1 multicolored sample from Ufaley Russia (59 points) were analyzed. All samples were tested with Raman and FTIR spectros- copy to ensure that they were all andradites [11]. Chemical analysis was done by laser ablation–icp MS. Concentrations of Mg, Al, Ti, V, Cr, and Mn were measured by laser abla- tion–inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA–icp 911 MS) using a Cetac LSX-213 G2 + laser ablation system coupled to a Thermo Fisher Scientific X-Series II icp MS system. Ca, Si, and Fe were also monitored to ensure the smoothness of the laser ablation process. Tuning and calibra- tion were carried out using NIST 610, 612, and 614 glass standards; reference values were taken from Jochum et al. [12]. The laser ablation was operated with a 100 µm spot size, a laser energy of 10% and a repetition rate of 10 Hz. 130 shots were made on each spot and the ablated products transferred to the icp MS with a flow rate of 500 cm3 m in−1 He gas. Each sample was measured at three different spots. Infrared spectra were collected with a Thermo Scientific iN10MX FTIR microscope in reflection mode using a liquid nitrogen cooled MCT detector. Spectra were collected from 680 to 4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 8 cm−1 and 16 scans were averaged for one spectrum. Raman spectra were col- lected with a Thermo Scientific DXR Raman microscope using a 780 nm laser. Spectra were recorded from 55 to 3400 cm−1 and automatically summarized until a signal to noise level of 500 was achieved. XPS measurements were performed using a Thermo Scientific Thetaprobe device, which was equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hη = 1486.6 eV) and dual flood gun for the surface charge neutralization. The X-ray spot on the measured sample surface was 400 µm in diameter. The survey spectra were recorded using a pass energy of 200 eV and an energy step width of 1 eV.

Each sample was measured at three different spots. Infrared spectra were collected with a Thermo Scientific iN10MX FTIR microscope in reflection mode using a liquid nitrogen cooled MCT detector. Spectra were collected from 680 to 4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 8 cm−1 and 16 scans were averaged for one spectrum. Raman spectra were col- lected with a Thermo Scientific DXR Raman microscope using a 780 nm laser. Spectra were recorded from 55 to 3400 cm−1 and automatically summarized until a signal to noise level of 500 was achieved. XPS measurements were performed using a Thermo Scientific Thetaprobe device, which was equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hη = 1486.6 eV) and dual flood gun for the surface charge neutralization. The X-ray spot on the measured sample surface was 400 µm in diameter. The survey spectra were recorded using a pass energy of 200 eV and an energy step width of 1 eV.

He has not only been one of the most influential teachers I had, but we also share a common hobby: minerals. So, what could be more suitable than a paper on the combination of chemistry and minerals? Garnets are a super group of minerals with the common formula M(II) M(III) [SiO ] , where M(II) are bivalent met- 3 2 4 3 als and M(III) are trivalent metals. They are further divided into ugrandites and pyralspites. Ugrandites have calcium in the M(II) position and either chromium (uwarowite), alu- minum (grossular), or iron (andradite) in the M(III) position and pyralyspites all have aluminum in their M(III) position and magnesium (pyrope), iron (almandine), or manganese * Clemens Schwarzinger clemens.schwarzinger@jku.at 1 Institute of Chemical Technology of Organic Materials, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria rigin by chemical fingerprinting 29 April 2019 the world and their prices vary depending on the location they was assembled and their chemical composition analyzed with y.

Additionally, garnets can form all kinds of solid mixtures and thus are often hard to classify [1]. Even more complex is the nomenclature of the gem trade. Here, often color or provenance is used to create names as they might sound more valuable to a customer, e.g., tsavorite for green grossular found in Eastern Africa or Malaya—meaning off color—garnets. In this paper we will focus on the species andradite, which when of green color is called demantoid (Fig. 1). The name is derived from diamond and means diamond-like, which is due to the fact that demantoids, when properly cut, have an equal sparkle and play of color as diamonds. This is due to the rather high refractive index of 1.88 and the very high dispersion of 0.057, which is even higher than that of diamond (0.044). Therefore, and because demantoids are much rarer than diamonds, they are highly priced [2]. Another factor that influences the price of gemstones is their provenance. While two gems might look similar in terms of color, cut, and clarity, their price can differ by several hundred percent if one can be assigned to a specific mine or at least a country, the best examples being sapphires Vol.:(0112 33456789)9 08 Fig. 1 Demantoid gemstones from Namibia (front row) and Russia (back row, from left to right: Bashenovskoe, Bobrovka/ Tagil, Ufaley) from Kashmir or rubies from Mogok, Myanmar. For deman- toids, it is Russian origin that increases the value. Tradition- ally, these provenances are assigned by gemmologists based on inclusions and experience and thus are often called expert opinions—which means that two experts might assign two different origins for one gemstone. Demantoids were originally found in the middle of the nineteenth century in the Ural Mountains of Russia [3, 4]: more exactly, in alluvial deposits in the River Bobrovka near the village Elizavetinskoye, close to Niznij Tagil, about 100 km north of Ekaterinburg. Later on other deposits were found in the Ural, roughly 90 km south of Ekaterin- burg, which are Poldnevskoye (Poldnevaya), Karkodin, and Ufaley. The Poldnevskoye deposit is also located on River Bobrovka, but not the same as the one where the original finds were made, which makes correct assignment of the localities sometimes impossible. In the 1990s a new deposit was found in Namibia in the Erongo Mountains close to Tubussis [5–7]. Unlike the Rus- sian stones, they are formed in skarns with no to very little chromium content. The cause of the green color is assumed to be an iron-based chromophore. In its heydays the Green Dragon mine produced five to ten thousand carats per year, with mostly stones between 2 and 3 mm, although very seldom cut stones of over 5 ct were produced. In 2008/09, another deposit was discovered in the mangrove swamps of Antetezambato in Northern Madagascar providing excel- lent crystals which resemble the Namibian material in their appearance [8]. Besides those major deposits, many other places have yielded demantoids such as Iran, Pakistan, Italy, or Canada, but mostly not in qualities or quantities to be of commercial importance. A current (February 2019) market analysis at the world’s largest gem shows in Tucson, USA, has shown that about 60–70% of all demantoids for sale are from Russia and around 25–30% from Namibia. Madagascan gems are very rare as there seems to be no production at the 1 3 C. Schwarzinger moment and only one set of demantoids from Iran was for sale, as well as two stones from Canada. In this paper, we will show that by using trace element analysis it is possible to differentiate between the most important countries of origin and even further in some cases between individual deposits. Results and discussion To be able to differentiate Russian stones from others, it is necessary to analyze and understand their chemistry first. We were able to obtain samples from all mentioned Russian localities, from Ufaley and Karkodin heated and unheated samples were available (heating of stones from these two localities is often necessary to remove the yellow tint and improve the green color) (Fig. 2) [9]. A special case com- prises the demantoids from Ufaley which are found as brown to red (heating to green) or bicolor brown-green crystals. One of these color zoned samples has been sliced and its chemical composition was measured from the brown core via the intense green middle part to the yellowish-green rim to reveal the different concentrations of minor elements within a single crystal. XPS analysis confirmed the crystal to be almost pure andradite with no significant variations of the Ca, Fe, Si, and O concentrations. Figure 3 shows that the concentration of titanium is highest in the brown core and gradually fades toward the outer part of the crys- tal. The intense green medium section, which is of highest commercial value, is dominated by chromium. Vanadium, which is very often also a reason of green color in minerals and sometimes even of more influence than chromium [10], does not seem to play an important role in the coloration of these garnets. In a first attempt to assign correct origins, all Russian and Namibian stones were analyzed and trends within theDetermination of demantoid garnet origin by chemical fingerprinting Fig. 2 Rough demantoid samples from Russian localities. Left to right: Ufaley 1 (heated), Ufaley 1 (unheated), Ufaley 2 (unheated), Ufaley 2 (heated), Karkodin (unheated), Karko- din (heated), Poldnevaya (unheated), Bobrovka/Tagil (unheated) Fig. 3 Distribution of trace elements along a crystal section (from center to rim) showing high titanium concentrations in the center and highest chro- mium concentrations in the green sections chemical composition traced. It could soon be seen that most of the Russian stones have concentrations of Cr and V (green chromophores) in the range of 100–10000 ppm, whereas Namibian stones rarely have those elements at all. On the other hand, Mn could be found in Namibian stones in the range of 1–2%, whereas in the Russian stones it was only present below 500 ppm. After some optimization, it was found that using the sum of V and Cr as well as the Mn/Ti ratio as criteria, a very good separation of the 42 Russian and 23 Namibian stones is possible (Fig. 4a). Both values are plotted on logarithmic scales separating the localities well with only a narrow zone of uncertainty. Also, the results obtained from the multicolored Ufaley sample are displayed using this plot and, although they spread along the Mn/Ti axis (Fig. 4b), a clear separation from the Namibian material is possible. The only Russian stones that cannot be sepa- rated are those from Bashenovskoe, but those are first of all rarities and not used commercially and can be distinguished from other demantoids as they typically have some percent- age of grossular [personal communication Ildar Latypov]. Having a closer look at the Russian localities, it could be found that using the Al/Mg ratio in combination with the Mn/Ti ratio even an identification of some individual mines is possible (Fig. 5). The Ufaley material has the highest Al/ Mg ratios and the Bashenovskoe material the highest Mn/ 909 Ti ratios, similar to the Namibian material. The deposits of Karkodin and Poldnevskoye are separated only by a few kilometers and therefore do not separate well in this diagram but form a group together. This group is only disturbed by a few spots assigned to the locality Bobrovka, which as stated in the introduction is either a river close to Elizavetinskoye where the original find was made or a river close to the Pol- dnevskoye deposit—so it is assumed that those samples are from the latter location. All other samples labeled Bobrovka or Russia are rather widespread in this plot, but show tenta- tively a lower Al/Mg ratio. One of the reasons for this can be that at the River Bobrovka alluvial deposits have been mined, which means that the stones were not found in the spot where they originally formed, but were washed out by the river and transported along with gravel. It is possible that they originate from more than one primary deposit, thus explaining the rather broad chemical distribution. The third commercially important location at the moment is Madagascar. The andradites from Antetezambato are formed in a geologically rather similar surrounding as in Namibia (skarn deposits) and also optically are more like their Namibian than their Russian counterparts. When using the Mn/Ti versus sum of Cr and V approach, the stones from Madagascar are easily separated from the ones from Namibia by their very low Mn/Ti ratio, but due to the fact 1 39 10 Fig. 4 a Separation of Russian and Namibian demantoids using trace a plot of manganese/titanium ratio vs. the sum of chromium and vanadium. Blue lines indicate the area of uncertainty; specimens from Bashenovskoe cannot be separated from Namibian gems using this Fig. 5 Separation of Ural demantoids using trace element ratios of manganese/titanium and aluminum/magnesium that some amount of Cr and/or V can be found they show up in the proximity of some Russian material (Fig. 6). A very effective way to differentiate stones from Mada- gascar is by looking at their Al content. Namibian stones typically have way below 1000 ppm and Russian stones, although having a higher content of mostly up to 2000 ppm, with Ufaley stones being an exception with 1500–6500 ppm, are clearly lower in Al than the Madagascar samples. The Al concentration in stones from Madagascar has always been found to be higher than 11000 ppm with maximum values being around 10% (it has to be noted that such concentra- tions are too high to be measured with LA–icp MS and tend 1 3 C.

Table 1 shows a summary of ranges found for each element in each deposit. Conclusion Using LA–icp MS it is possible to determine the concen- tration of several elements that can be used for the deter- mination of the origin of demantoid garnets.

The famous bright green Russian stones owe their color to a high concentration of Cr and/or V—which is a good indicator—but not all Russian stones have sig- nificantly higher values then other stones. But in combina- tion with low Mn and high Ti concentrations, they can be separated from their Namibian counterparts. Material from Madagascar typically has an even lower Mn/Ti ratio, but might have some Cr and especially V; however, due to their extremely high Al content, they can also be easily separated from all other sources. What is absolutely necessary for such a model to work is that a significant number of reference samples with proven origin must be available and that the database is always kept up to date as new deposits are still being found. Some rari- ties might not be assigned correctly by the approach pre- sented here, as not all locations have been included yet into the study but the focus at this time has been the identification of those gems that are currently dominating on the market. Materials and methods Rough demantoid samples were collected from Tubussis (Namibia), Ufaley (Russia), Karkodin (Russia), Poldnevs- koye (Russia), Bobrovka (Russia), Bashenovskoe (Russia), and Antetezambato (Madagascar). Cut stones were either cut by the author or taken from the collection of the Aus- trian Gemmological Society or the collection of Gerhard Brandstetter. Many of the cut stones were only labeled “Rus- sia” with no details of the mine. A total of 42 Russian (126 points), 23 Namibian (69 points), 2 Madagascar (14 points), and 1 multicolored sample from Ufaley Russia (59 points) were analyzed. All samples were tested with Raman and FTIR spectros- copy to ensure that they were all andradites [11]. Chemical analysis was done by laser ablation–icp MS. Concentrations of Mg, Al, Ti, V, Cr, and Mn were measured by laser abla- tion–inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA–icp 911 MS) using a Cetac LSX-213 G2 + laser ablation system coupled to a Thermo Fisher Scientific X-Series II icp MS system. Ca, Si, and Fe were also monitored to ensure the smoothness of the laser ablation process. Tuning and calibra- tion were carried out using NIST 610, 612, and 614 glass standards; reference values were taken from Jochum et al. [12]. The laser ablation was operated with a 100 µm spot size, a laser energy of 10% and a repetition rate of 10 Hz. 130 shots were made on each spot and the ablated products transferred to the icp MS with a flow rate of 500 cm3 m in−1 He gas. Each sample was measured at three different spots. Infrared spectra were collected with a Thermo Scientific iN10MX FTIR microscope in reflection mode using a liquid nitrogen cooled MCT detector. Spectra were collected from 680 to 4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 8 cm−1 and 16 scans were averaged for one spectrum. Raman spectra were col- lected with a Thermo Scientific DXR Raman microscope using a 780 nm laser. Spectra were recorded from 55 to 3400 cm−1 and automatically summarized until a signal to noise level of 500 was achieved. XPS measurements were performed using a Thermo Scientific Thetaprobe device, which was equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hη = 1486.6 eV) and dual flood gun for the surface charge neutralization. The X-ray spot on the measured sample surface was 400 µm in diameter. The survey spectra were recorded using a pass energy of 200 eV and an energy step width of 1 eV.

A very effective way to differentiate stones from Mada- gascar is by looking at their Al content. Namibian stones typically have way below 1000 ppm and Russian stones, although having a higher content of mostly up to 2000 ppm, with Ufaley stones being an exception with 1500–6500 ppm, are clearly lower in Al than the Madagascar samples. The Al concentration in stones from Madagascar has always been found to be higher than 11000 ppm with maximum values being around 10% (it has to be noted that such concentra- tions are too high to be measured with LA–icp MS and tend 1 3 C.

But in combina- tion with low Mn and high Ti concentrations, they can be separated from their Namibian counterparts. Material from Madagascar typically has an even lower Mn/Ti ratio, but might have some Cr and especially V; however, due to their extremely high Al content, they can also be easily separated from all other sources. What is absolutely necessary for such a model to work is that a significant number of reference samples with proven origin must be available and that the database is always kept up to date as new deposits are still being found. Some rari- ties might not be assigned correctly by the approach pre- sented here, as not all locations have been included yet into the study but the focus at this time has been the identification of those gems that are currently dominating on the market. Materials and methods Rough demantoid samples were collected from Tubussis (Namibia), Ufaley (Russia), Karkodin (Russia), Poldnevs- koye (Russia), Bobrovka (Russia), Bashenovskoe (Russia), and Antetezambato (Madagascar). Cut stones were either cut by the author or taken from the collection of the Aus- trian Gemmological Society or the collection of Gerhard Brandstetter. Many of the cut stones were only labeled “Rus- sia” with no details of the mine. A total of 42 Russian (126 points), 23 Namibian (69 points), 2 Madagascar (14 points), and 1 multicolored sample from Ufaley Russia (59 points) were analyzed. All samples were tested with Raman and FTIR spectros- copy to ensure that they were all andradites [11]. Chemical analysis was done by laser ablation–icp MS. Concentrations of Mg, Al, Ti, V, Cr, and Mn were measured by laser abla- tion–inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA–icp 911 MS) using a Cetac LSX-213 G2 + laser ablation system coupled to a Thermo Fisher Scientific X-Series II icp MS system. Ca, Si, and Fe were also monitored to ensure the smoothness of the laser ablation process. Tuning and calibra- tion were carried out using NIST 610, 612, and 614 glass standards; reference values were taken from Jochum et al. [12]. The laser ablation was operated with a 100 µm spot size, a laser energy of 10% and a repetition rate of 10 Hz. 130 shots were made on each spot and the ablated products transferred to the icp MS with a flow rate of 500 cm3 m in−1 He gas. Each sample was measured at three different spots. Infrared spectra were collected with a Thermo Scientific iN10MX FTIR microscope in reflection mode using a liquid nitrogen cooled MCT detector. Spectra were collected from 680 to 4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 8 cm−1 and 16 scans were averaged for one spectrum. Raman spectra were col- lected with a Thermo Scientific DXR Raman microscope using a 780 nm laser. Spectra were recorded from 55 to 3400 cm−1 and automatically summarized until a signal to noise level of 500 was achieved. XPS measurements were performed using a Thermo Scientific Thetaprobe device, which was equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hη = 1486.6 eV) and dual flood gun for the surface charge neutralization. The X-ray spot on the measured sample surface was 400 µm in diameter. The survey spectra were recorded using a pass energy of 200 eV and an energy step width of 1 eV.

He has not only been one of the most influential teachers I had, but we also share a common hobby: minerals. So, what could be more suitable than a paper on the combination of chemistry and minerals? Garnets are a super group of minerals with the common formula M(II) M(III) [SiO ] , where M(II) are bivalent met- 3 2 4 3 als and M(III) are trivalent metals. They are further divided into ugrandites and pyralspites. Ugrandites have calcium in the M(II) position and either chromium (uwarowite), alu- minum (grossular), or iron (andradite) in the M(III) position and pyralyspites all have aluminum in their M(III) position and magnesium (pyrope), iron (almandine), or manganese * Clemens Schwarzinger clemens.schwarzinger@jku.at 1 Institute of Chemical Technology of Organic Materials, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria rigin by chemical fingerprinting 29 April 2019 the world and their prices vary depending on the location they was assembled and their chemical composition analyzed with y.

Additionally, garnets can form all kinds of solid mixtures and thus are often hard to classify [1]. Even more complex is the nomenclature of the gem trade. Here, often color or provenance is used to create names as they might sound more valuable to a customer, e.g., tsavorite for green grossular found in Eastern Africa or Malaya—meaning off color—garnets. In this paper we will focus on the species andradite, which when of green color is called demantoid (Fig. 1). The name is derived from diamond and means diamond-like, which is due to the fact that demantoids, when properly cut, have an equal sparkle and play of color as diamonds. This is due to the rather high refractive index of 1.88 and the very high dispersion of 0.057, which is even higher than that of diamond (0.044). Therefore, and because demantoids are much rarer than diamonds, they are highly priced [2]. Another factor that influences the price of gemstones is their provenance. While two gems might look similar in terms of color, cut, and clarity, their price can differ by several hundred percent if one can be assigned to a specific mine or at least a country, the best examples being sapphires Vol.:(0112 33456789)9 08 Fig. 1 Demantoid gemstones from Namibia (front row) and Russia (back row, from left to right: Bashenovskoe, Bobrovka/ Tagil, Ufaley) from Kashmir or rubies from Mogok, Myanmar. For deman- toids, it is Russian origin that increases the value. Tradition- ally, these provenances are assigned by gemmologists based on inclusions and experience and thus are often called expert opinions—which means that two experts might assign two different origins for one gemstone. Demantoids were originally found in the middle of the nineteenth century in the Ural Mountains of Russia [3, 4]: more exactly, in alluvial deposits in the River Bobrovka near the village Elizavetinskoye, close to Niznij Tagil, about 100 km north of Ekaterinburg. Later on other deposits were found in the Ural, roughly 90 km south of Ekaterin- burg, which are Poldnevskoye (Poldnevaya), Karkodin, and Ufaley. The Poldnevskoye deposit is also located on River Bobrovka, but not the same as the one where the original finds were made, which makes correct assignment of the localities sometimes impossible. In the 1990s a new deposit was found in Namibia in the Erongo Mountains close to Tubussis [5–7]. Unlike the Rus- sian stones, they are formed in skarns with no to very little chromium content. The cause of the green color is assumed to be an iron-based chromophore. In its heydays the Green Dragon mine produced five to ten thousand carats per year, with mostly stones between 2 and 3 mm, although very seldom cut stones of over 5 ct were produced. In 2008/09, another deposit was discovered in the mangrove swamps of Antetezambato in Northern Madagascar providing excel- lent crystals which resemble the Namibian material in their appearance [8]. Besides those major deposits, many other places have yielded demantoids such as Iran, Pakistan, Italy, or Canada, but mostly not in qualities or quantities to be of commercial importance. A current (February 2019) market analysis at the world’s largest gem shows in Tucson, USA, has shown that about 60–70% of all demantoids for sale are from Russia and around 25–30% from Namibia. Madagascan gems are very rare as there seems to be no production at the 1 3 C. Schwarzinger moment and only one set of demantoids from Iran was for sale, as well as two stones from Canada. In this paper, we will show that by using trace element analysis it is possible to differentiate between the most important countries of origin and even further in some cases between individual deposits. Results and discussion To be able to differentiate Russian stones from others, it is necessary to analyze and understand their chemistry first. We were able to obtain samples from all mentioned Russian localities, from Ufaley and Karkodin heated and unheated samples were available (heating of stones from these two localities is often necessary to remove the yellow tint and improve the green color) (Fig. 2) [9]. A special case com- prises the demantoids from Ufaley which are found as brown to red (heating to green) or bicolor brown-green crystals. One of these color zoned samples has been sliced and its chemical composition was measured from the brown core via the intense green middle part to the yellowish-green rim to reveal the different concentrations of minor elements within a single crystal. XPS analysis confirmed the crystal to be almost pure andradite with no significant variations of the Ca, Fe, Si, and O concentrations. Figure 3 shows that the concentration of titanium is highest in the brown core and gradually fades toward the outer part of the crys- tal. The intense green medium section, which is of highest commercial value, is dominated by chromium. Vanadium, which is very often also a reason of green color in minerals and sometimes even of more influence than chromium [10], does not seem to play an important role in the coloration of these garnets. In a first attempt to assign correct origins, all Russian and Namibian stones were analyzed and trends within theDetermination of demantoid garnet origin by chemical fingerprinting Fig. 2 Rough demantoid samples from Russian localities. Left to right: Ufaley 1 (heated), Ufaley 1 (unheated), Ufaley 2 (unheated), Ufaley 2 (heated), Karkodin (unheated), Karko- din (heated), Poldnevaya (unheated), Bobrovka/Tagil (unheated) Fig. 3 Distribution of trace elements along a crystal section (from center to rim) showing high titanium concentrations in the center and highest chro- mium concentrations in the green sections chemical composition traced. It could soon be seen that most of the Russian stones have concentrations of Cr and V (green chromophores) in the range of 100–10000 ppm, whereas Namibian stones rarely have those elements at all. On the other hand, Mn could be found in Namibian stones in the range of 1–2%, whereas in the Russian stones it was only present below 500 ppm. After some optimization, it was found that using the sum of V and Cr as well as the Mn/Ti ratio as criteria, a very good separation of the 42 Russian and 23 Namibian stones is possible (Fig. 4a). Both values are plotted on logarithmic scales separating the localities well with only a narrow zone of uncertainty. Also, the results obtained from the multicolored Ufaley sample are displayed using this plot and, although they spread along the Mn/Ti axis (Fig. 4b), a clear separation from the Namibian material is possible. The only Russian stones that cannot be sepa- rated are those from Bashenovskoe, but those are first of all rarities and not used commercially and can be distinguished from other demantoids as they typically have some percent- age of grossular [personal communication Ildar Latypov]. Having a closer look at the Russian localities, it could be found that using the Al/Mg ratio in combination with the Mn/Ti ratio even an identification of some individual mines is possible (Fig. 5). The Ufaley material has the highest Al/ Mg ratios and the Bashenovskoe material the highest Mn/ 909 Ti ratios, similar to the Namibian material. The deposits of Karkodin and Poldnevskoye are separated only by a few kilometers and therefore do not separate well in this diagram but form a group together. This group is only disturbed by a few spots assigned to the locality Bobrovka, which as stated in the introduction is either a river close to Elizavetinskoye where the original find was made or a river close to the Pol- dnevskoye deposit—so it is assumed that those samples are from the latter location. All other samples labeled Bobrovka or Russia are rather widespread in this plot, but show tenta- tively a lower Al/Mg ratio. One of the reasons for this can be that at the River Bobrovka alluvial deposits have been mined, which means that the stones were not found in the spot where they originally formed, but were washed out by the river and transported along with gravel. It is possible that they originate from more than one primary deposit, thus explaining the rather broad chemical distribution. The third commercially important location at the moment is Madagascar. The andradites from Antetezambato are formed in a geologically rather similar surrounding as in Namibia (skarn deposits) and also optically are more like their Namibian than their Russian counterparts. When using the Mn/Ti versus sum of Cr and V approach, the stones from Madagascar are easily separated from the ones from Namibia by their very low Mn/Ti ratio, but due to the fact 1 39 10 Fig. 4 a Separation of Russian and Namibian demantoids using trace a plot of manganese/titanium ratio vs. the sum of chromium and vanadium.

A current (February 2019) market analysis at the world’s largest gem shows in Tucson, USA, has shown that about 60–70% of all demantoids for sale are from Russia and around 25–30% from Namibia. Madagascan gems are very rare as there seems to be no production at the 1 3 C. Schwarzinger moment and only one set of demantoids from Iran was for sale, as well as two stones from Canada. In this paper, we will show that by using trace element analysis it is possible to differentiate between the most important countries of origin and even further in some cases between individual deposits. Results and discussion To be able to differentiate Russian stones from others, it is necessary to analyze and understand their chemistry first. We were able to obtain samples from all mentioned Russian localities, from Ufaley and Karkodin heated and unheated samples were available (heating of stones from these two localities is often necessary to remove the yellow tint and improve the green color) (Fig. 2) [9]. A special case com- prises the demantoids from Ufaley which are found as brown to red (heating to green) or bicolor brown-green crystals. One of these color zoned samples has been sliced and its chemical composition was measured from the brown core via the intense green middle part to the yellowish-green rim to reveal the different concentrations of minor elements within a single crystal. XPS analysis confirmed the crystal to be almost pure andradite with no significant variations of the Ca, Fe, Si, and O concentrations. Figure 3 shows that the concentration of titanium is highest in the brown core and gradually fades toward the outer part of the crys- tal. The intense green medium section, which is of highest commercial value, is dominated by chromium. Vanadium, which is very often also a reason of green color in minerals and sometimes even of more influence than chromium [10], does not seem to play an important role in the coloration of these garnets. In a first attempt to assign correct origins, all Russian and Namibian stones were analyzed and trends within theDetermination of demantoid garnet origin by chemical fingerprinting Fig. 2 Rough demantoid samples from Russian localities. Left to right: Ufaley 1 (heated), Ufaley 1 (unheated), Ufaley 2 (unheated), Ufaley 2 (heated), Karkodin (unheated), Karko- din (heated), Poldnevaya (unheated), Bobrovka/Tagil (unheated) Fig. 3 Distribution of trace elements along a crystal section (from center to rim) showing high titanium concentrations in the center and highest chro- mium concentrations in the green sections chemical composition traced. It could soon be seen that most of the Russian stones have concentrations of Cr and V (green chromophores) in the range of 100–10000 ppm, whereas Namibian stones rarely have those elements at all. On the other hand, Mn could be found in Namibian stones in the range of 1–2%, whereas in the Russian stones it was only present below 500 ppm. After some optimization, it was found that using the sum of V and Cr as well as the Mn/Ti ratio as criteria, a very good separation of the 42 Russian and 23 Namibian stones is possible (Fig. 4a). Both values are plotted on logarithmic scales separating the localities well with only a narrow zone of uncertainty. Also, the results obtained from the multicolored Ufaley sample are displayed using this plot and, although they spread along the Mn/Ti axis (Fig. 4b), a clear separation from the Namibian material is possible. The only Russian stones that cannot be sepa- rated are those from Bashenovskoe, but those are first of all rarities and not used commercially and can be distinguished from other demantoids as they typically have some percent- age of grossular [personal communication Ildar Latypov]. Having a closer look at the Russian localities, it could be found that using the Al/Mg ratio in combination with the Mn/Ti ratio even an identification of some individual mines is possible (Fig. 5). The Ufaley material has the highest Al/ Mg ratios and the Bashenovskoe material the highest Mn/ 909 Ti ratios, similar to the Namibian material. The deposits of Karkodin and Poldnevskoye are separated only by a few kilometers and therefore do not separate well in this diagram but form a group together. This group is only disturbed by a few spots assigned to the locality Bobrovka, which as stated in the introduction is either a river close to Elizavetinskoye where the original find was made or a river close to the Pol- dnevskoye deposit—so it is assumed that those samples are from the latter location. All other samples labeled Bobrovka or Russia are rather widespread in this plot, but show tenta- tively a lower Al/Mg ratio. One of the reasons for this can be that at the River Bobrovka alluvial deposits have been mined, which means that the stones were not found in the spot where they originally formed, but were washed out by the river and transported along with gravel. It is possible that they originate from more than one primary deposit, thus explaining the rather broad chemical distribution. The third commercially important location at the moment is Madagascar. The andradites from Antetezambato are formed in a geologically rather similar surrounding as in Namibia (skarn deposits) and also optically are more like their Namibian than their Russian counterparts. When using the Mn/Ti versus sum of Cr and V approach, the stones from Madagascar are easily separated from the ones from Namibia by their very low Mn/Ti ratio, but due to the fact 1 39 10 Fig. 4 a Separation of Russian and Namibian demantoids using trace a plot of manganese/titanium ratio vs. the sum of chromium and vanadium.

A very effective way to differentiate stones from Mada- gascar is by looking at their Al content. Namibian stones typically have way below 1000 ppm and Russian stones, although having a higher content of mostly up to 2000 ppm, with Ufaley stones being an exception with 1500–6500 ppm, are clearly lower in Al than the Madagascar samples. The Al concentration in stones from Madagascar has always been found to be higher than 11000 ppm with maximum values being around 10% (it has to be noted that such concentra- tions are too high to be measured with LA–icp MS and tend 1 3 C.

Conclusion Using LA–icp MS it is possible to determine the concen- tration of several elements that can be used for the deter- mination of the origin of demantoid garnets.

The famous bright green Russian stones owe their color to a high concentration of Cr and/or V—which is a good indicator—but not all Russian stones have sig- nificantly higher values then other stones. But in combina- tion with low Mn and high Ti concentrations, they can be separated from their Namibian counterparts. Material from Madagascar typically has an even lower Mn/Ti ratio, but might have some Cr and especially V; however, due to their extremely high Al content, they can also be easily separated from all other sources. What is absolutely necessary for such a model to work is that a significant number of reference samples with proven origin must be available and that the database is always kept up to date as new deposits are still being found. Some rari- ties might not be assigned correctly by the approach pre- sented here, as not all locations have been included yet into the study but the focus at this time has been the identification of those gems that are currently dominating on the market. Materials and methods Rough demantoid samples were collected from Tubussis (Namibia), Ufaley (Russia), Karkodin (Russia), Poldnevs- koye (Russia), Bobrovka (Russia), Bashenovskoe (Russia), and Antetezambato (Madagascar). Cut stones were either cut by the author or taken from the collection of the Aus- trian Gemmological Society or the collection of Gerhard Brandstetter. Many of the cut stones were only labeled “Rus- sia” with no details of the mine. A total of 42 Russian (126 points), 23 Namibian (69 points), 2 Madagascar (14 points), and 1 multicolored sample from Ufaley Russia (59 points) were analyzed. All samples were tested with Raman and FTIR spectros- copy to ensure that they were all andradites [11]. Chemical analysis was done by laser ablation–icp MS. Concentrations of Mg, Al, Ti, V, Cr, and Mn were measured by laser abla- tion–inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA–icp 911 MS) using a Cetac LSX-213 G2 + laser ablation system coupled to a Thermo Fisher Scientific X-Series II icp MS system. Ca, Si, and Fe were also monitored to ensure the smoothness of the laser ablation process. Tuning and calibra- tion were carried out using NIST 610, 612, and 614 glass standards; reference values were taken from Jochum et al. [12]. The laser ablation was operated with a 100 µm spot size, a laser energy of 10% and a repetition rate of 10 Hz. 130 shots were made on each spot and the ablated products transferred to the icp MS with a flow rate of 500 cm3 m in−1 He gas. Each sample was measured at three different spots. Infrared spectra were collected with a Thermo Scientific iN10MX FTIR microscope in reflection mode using a liquid nitrogen cooled MCT detector. Spectra were collected from 680 to 4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 8 cm−1 and 16 scans were averaged for one spectrum. Raman spectra were col- lected with a Thermo Scientific DXR Raman microscope using a 780 nm laser. Spectra were recorded from 55 to 3400 cm−1 and automatically summarized until a signal to noise level of 500 was achieved. XPS measurements were performed using a Thermo Scientific Thetaprobe device, which was equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hη = 1486.6 eV) and dual flood gun for the surface charge neutralization. The X-ray spot on the measured sample surface was 400 µm in diameter. The survey spectra were recorded using a pass energy of 200 eV and an energy step width of 1 eV.

They are further divided into ugrandites and pyralspites.

Additionally, garnets can form all kinds of solid mixtures and thus are often hard to classify [1]. Even more complex is the nomenclature of the gem trade. Here, often color or provenance is used to create names as they might sound more valuable to a customer, e.g., tsavorite for green grossular found in Eastern Africa or Malaya—meaning off color—garnets. In this paper we will focus on the species andradite, which when of green color is called demantoid (Fig. 1). The name is derived from diamond and means diamond-like, which is due to the fact that demantoids, when properly cut, have an equal sparkle and play of color as diamonds. This is due to the rather high refractive index of 1.88 and the very high dispersion of 0.057, which is even higher than that of diamond (0.044). Therefore, and because demantoids are much rarer than diamonds, they are highly priced [2]. Another factor that influences the price of gemstones is their provenance. While two gems might look similar in terms of color, cut, and clarity, their price can differ by several hundred percent if one can be assigned to a specific mine or at least a country, the best examples being sapphires Vol.:(0112 33456789)9 08 Fig. 1 Demantoid gemstones from Namibia (front row) and Russia (back row, from left to right: Bashenovskoe, Bobrovka/ Tagil, Ufaley) from Kashmir or rubies from Mogok, Myanmar. For deman- toids, it is Russian origin that increases the value. Tradition- ally, these provenances are assigned by gemmologists based on inclusions and experience and thus are often called expert opinions—which means that two experts might assign two different origins for one gemstone. Demantoids were originally found in the middle of the nineteenth century in the Ural Mountains of Russia [3, 4]: more exactly, in alluvial deposits in the River Bobrovka near the village Elizavetinskoye, close to Niznij Tagil, about 100 km north of Ekaterinburg. Later on other deposits were found in the Ural, roughly 90 km south of Ekaterin- burg, which are Poldnevskoye (Poldnevaya), Karkodin, and Ufaley. The Poldnevskoye deposit is also located on River Bobrovka, but not the same as the one where the original finds were made, which makes correct assignment of the localities sometimes impossible. In the 1990s a new deposit was found in Namibia in the Erongo Mountains close to Tubussis [5–7]. Unlike the Rus- sian stones, they are formed in skarns with no to very little chromium content. The cause of the green color is assumed to be an iron-based chromophore. In its heydays the Green Dragon mine produced five to ten thousand carats per year, with mostly stones between 2 and 3 mm, although very seldom cut stones of over 5 ct were produced. In 2008/09, another deposit was discovered in the mangrove swamps of Antetezambato in Northern Madagascar providing excel- lent crystals which resemble the Namibian material in their appearance [8]. Besides those major deposits, many other places have yielded demantoids such as Iran, Pakistan, Italy, or Canada, but mostly not in qualities or quantities to be of commercial importance. A current (February 2019) market analysis at the world’s largest gem shows in Tucson, USA, has shown that about 60–70% of all demantoids for sale are from Russia and around 25–30% from Namibia. Madagascan gems are very rare as there seems to be no production at the 1 3 C. Schwarzinger moment and only one set of demantoids from Iran was for sale, as well as two stones from Canada. In this paper, we will show that by using trace element analysis it is possible to differentiate between the most important countries of origin and even further in some cases between individual deposits.

Ugrandites have calcium in the M(II) position and either chromium (uwarowite), alu- minum (grossular), or iron (andradite) in the M(III) position and pyralyspites all have aluminum in their M(III) position and magnesium (pyrope), iron (almandine), or manganese * Clemens Schwarzinger clemens.schwarzinger@jku.at 1 Institute of Chemical Technology of Organic Materials, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria rigin by chemical fingerprinting 29 April 2019 the world and their prices vary depending on the location they was assembled and their chemical composition analyzed with y.

Additionally, garnets can form all kinds of solid mixtures and thus are often hard to classify [1]. Even more complex is the nomenclature of the gem trade. Here, often color or provenance is used to create names as they might sound more valuable to a customer, e.g., tsavorite for green grossular found in Eastern Africa or Malaya—meaning off color—garnets. In this paper we will focus on the species andradite, which when of green color is called demantoid (Fig. 1). The name is derived from diamond and means diamond-like, which is due to the fact that demantoids, when properly cut, have an equal sparkle and play of color as diamonds. This is due to the rather high refractive index of 1.88 and the very high dispersion of 0.057, which is even higher than that of diamond (0.044). Therefore, and because demantoids are much rarer than diamonds, they are highly priced [2]. Another factor that influences the price of gemstones is their provenance. While two gems might look similar in terms of color, cut, and clarity, their price can differ by several hundred percent if one can be assigned to a specific mine or at least a country, the best examples being sapphires Vol.:(0112 33456789)9 08 Fig. 1 Demantoid gemstones from Namibia (front row) and Russia (back row, from left to right: Bashenovskoe, Bobrovka/ Tagil, Ufaley) from Kashmir or rubies from Mogok, Myanmar. For deman- toids, it is Russian origin that increases the value. Tradition- ally, these provenances are assigned by gemmologists based on inclusions and experience and thus are often called expert opinions—which means that two experts might assign two different origins for one gemstone. Demantoids were originally found in the middle of the nineteenth century in the Ural Mountains of Russia [3, 4]: more exactly, in alluvial deposits in the River Bobrovka near the village Elizavetinskoye, close to Niznij Tagil, about 100 km north of Ekaterinburg. Later on other deposits were found in the Ural, roughly 90 km south of Ekaterin- burg, which are Poldnevskoye (Poldnevaya), Karkodin, and Ufaley. The Poldnevskoye deposit is also located on River Bobrovka, but not the same as the one where the original finds were made, which makes correct assignment of the localities sometimes impossible. In the 1990s a new deposit was found in Namibia in the Erongo Mountains close to Tubussis [5–7]. Unlike the Rus- sian stones, they are formed in skarns with no to very little chromium content. The cause of the green color is assumed to be an iron-based chromophore. In its heydays the Green Dragon mine produced five to ten thousand carats per year, with mostly stones between 2 and 3 mm, although very seldom cut stones of over 5 ct were produced. In 2008/09, another deposit was discovered in the mangrove swamps of Antetezambato in Northern Madagascar providing excel- lent crystals which resemble the Namibian material in their appearance [8]. Besides those major deposits, many other places have yielded demantoids such as Iran, Pakistan, Italy, or Canada, but mostly not in qualities or quantities to be of commercial importance. A current (February 2019) market analysis at the world’s largest gem shows in Tucson, USA, has shown that about 60–70% of all demantoids for sale are from Russia and around 25–30% from Namibia. Madagascan gems are very rare as there seems to be no production at the 1 3 C. Schwarzinger moment and only one set of demantoids from Iran was for sale, as well as two stones from Canada. In this paper, we will show that by using trace element analysis it is possible to differentiate between the most important countries of origin and even further in some cases between individual deposits. Results and discussion To be able to differentiate Russian stones from others, it is necessary to analyze and understand their chemistry first. We were able to obtain samples from all mentioned Russian localities, from Ufaley and Karkodin heated and unheated samples were available (heating of stones from these two localities is often necessary to remove the yellow tint and improve the green color) (Fig. 2) [9]. A special case com- prises the demantoids from Ufaley which are found as brown to red (heating to green) or bicolor brown-green crystals. One of these color zoned samples has been sliced and its chemical composition was measured from the brown core via the intense green middle part to the yellowish-green rim to reveal the different concentrations of minor elements within a single crystal. XPS analysis confirmed the crystal to be almost pure andradite with no significant variations of the Ca, Fe, Si, and O concentrations. Figure 3 shows that the concentration of titanium is highest in the brown core and gradually fades toward the outer part of the crys- tal. The intense green medium section, which is of highest commercial value, is dominated by chromium. Vanadium, which is very often also a reason of green color in minerals and sometimes even of more influence than chromium [10], does not seem to play an important role in the coloration of these garnets. In a first attempt to assign correct origins, all Russian and Namibian stones were analyzed and trends within theDetermination of demantoid garnet origin by chemical fingerprinting Fig. 2 Rough demantoid samples from Russian localities.

It could soon be seen that most of the Russian stones have concentrations of Cr and V (green chromophores) in the range of 100–10000 ppm, whereas Namibian stones rarely have those elements at all. On the other hand, Mn could be found in Namibian stones in the range of 1–2%, whereas in the Russian stones it was only present below 500 ppm. After some optimization, it was found that using the sum of V and Cr as well as the Mn/Ti ratio as criteria, a very good separation of the 42 Russian and 23 Namibian stones is possible (Fig. 4a). Both values are plotted on logarithmic scales separating the localities well with only a narrow zone of uncertainty. Also, the results obtained from the multicolored Ufaley sample are displayed using this plot and, although they spread along the Mn/Ti axis (Fig. 4b), a clear separation from the Namibian material is possible. The only Russian stones that cannot be sepa- rated are those from Bashenovskoe, but those are first of all rarities and not used commercially and can be distinguished from other demantoids as they typically have some percent- age of grossular [personal communication Ildar Latypov]. Having a closer look at the Russian localities, it could be found that using the Al/Mg ratio in combination with the Mn/Ti ratio even an identification of some individual mines is possible (Fig. 5). The Ufaley material has the highest Al/ Mg ratios and the Bashenovskoe material the highest Mn/ 909 Ti ratios, similar to the Namibian material. The deposits of Karkodin and Poldnevskoye are separated only by a few kilometers and therefore do not separate well in this diagram but form a group together. This group is only disturbed by a few spots assigned to the locality Bobrovka, which as stated in the introduction is either a river close to Elizavetinskoye where the original find was made or a river close to the Pol- dnevskoye deposit—so it is assumed that those samples are from the latter location. All other samples labeled Bobrovka or Russia are rather widespread in this plot, but show tenta- tively a lower Al/Mg ratio. One of the reasons for this can be that at the River Bobrovka alluvial deposits have been mined, which means that the stones were not found in the spot where they originally formed, but were washed out by the river and transported along with gravel. It is possible that they originate from more than one primary deposit, thus explaining the rather broad chemical distribution. The third commercially important location at the moment is Madagascar. The andradites from Antetezambato are formed in a geologically rather similar surrounding as in Namibia (skarn deposits) and also optically are more like their Namibian than their Russian counterparts. When using the Mn/Ti versus sum of Cr and V approach, the stones from Madagascar are easily separated from the ones from Namibia by their very low Mn/Ti ratio, but due to the fact 1 39 10 Fig. 4 a Separation of Russian and Namibian demantoids using trace a plot of manganese/titanium ratio vs. the sum of chromium and vanadium. Blue lines indicate the area of uncertainty; specimens from Bashenovskoe cannot be separated from Namibian gems using this Fig. 5 Separation of Ural demantoids using trace element ratios of manganese/titanium and aluminum/magnesium that some amount of Cr and/or V can be found they show up in the proximity of some Russian material (Fig. 6). A very effective way to differentiate stones from Mada- gascar is by looking at their Al content. Namibian stones typically have way below 1000 ppm and Russian stones, although having a higher content of mostly up to 2000 ppm, with Ufaley stones being an exception with 1500–6500 ppm, are clearly lower in Al than the Madagascar samples. The Al concentration in stones from Madagascar has always been found to be higher than 11000 ppm with maximum values being around 10% (it has to be noted that such concentra- tions are too high to be measured with LA–icp MS and tend 1 3 C.

Table 1 shows a summary of ranges found for each element in each deposit. Conclusion Using LA–icp MS it is possible to determine the concen- tration of several elements that can be used for the deter- mination of the origin of demantoid garnets.

The famous bright green Russian stones owe their color to a high concentration of Cr and/or V—which is a good indicator—but not all Russian stones have sig- nificantly higher values then other stones. But in combina- tion with low Mn and high Ti concentrations, they can be separated from their Namibian counterparts. Material from Madagascar typically has an even lower Mn/Ti ratio, but might have some Cr and especially V; however, due to their extremely high Al content, they can also be easily separated from all other sources. What is absolutely necessary for such a model to work is that a significant number of reference samples with proven origin must be available and that the database is always kept up to date as new deposits are still being found. Some rari- ties might not be assigned correctly by the approach pre- sented here, as not all locations have been included yet into the study but the focus at this time has been the identification of those gems that are currently dominating on the market. Materials and methods Rough demantoid samples were collected from Tubussis (Namibia), Ufaley (Russia), Karkodin (Russia), Poldnevs- koye (Russia), Bobrovka (Russia), Bashenovskoe (Russia), and Antetezambato (Madagascar). Cut stones were either cut by the author or taken from the collection of the Aus- trian Gemmological Society or the collection of Gerhard Brandstetter. Many of the cut stones were only labeled “Rus- sia” with no details of the mine. A total of 42 Russian (126 points), 23 Namibian (69 points), 2 Madagascar (14 points), and 1 multicolored sample from Ufaley Russia (59 points) were analyzed. All samples were tested with Raman and FTIR spectros- copy to ensure that they were all andradites [11]. Chemical analysis was done by laser ablation–icp MS. Concentrations of Mg, Al, Ti, V, Cr, and Mn were measured by laser abla- tion–inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA–icp 911 MS) using a Cetac LSX-213 G2 + laser ablation system coupled to a Thermo Fisher Scientific X-Series II icp MS system. Ca, Si, and Fe were also monitored to ensure the smoothness of the laser ablation process. Tuning and calibra- tion were carried out using NIST 610, 612, and 614 glass standards; reference values were taken from Jochum et al. [12]. The laser ablation was operated with a 100 µm spot size, a laser energy of 10% and a repetition rate of 10 Hz. 130 shots were made on each spot and the ablated products transferred to the icp MS with a flow rate of 500 cm3 m in−1 He gas. Each sample was measured at three different spots. Infrared spectra were collected with a Thermo Scientific iN10MX FTIR microscope in reflection mode using a liquid nitrogen cooled MCT detector. Spectra were collected from 680 to 4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 8 cm−1 and 16 scans were averaged for one spectrum. Raman spectra were col- lected with a Thermo Scientific DXR Raman microscope using a 780 nm laser. Spectra were recorded from 55 to 3400 cm−1 and automatically summarized until a signal to noise level of 500 was achieved. XPS measurements were performed using a Thermo Scientific Thetaprobe device, which was equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hη = 1486.6 eV) and dual flood gun for the surface charge neutralization. The X-ray spot on the measured sample surface was 400 µm in diameter. The survey spectra were recorded using a pass energy of 200 eV and an energy step width of 1 eV.
