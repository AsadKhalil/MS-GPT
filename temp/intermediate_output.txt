Abstract: Fenpyroximate is an efficient, broad-spectrum phenoxypyrazole acaricide which is used for
controlling various mites. In this study, we measured the levels of terminal fenpyroximate residues in
citrus fruits, and estimated the dietary intake risks posed by fenpyroximate. To this end, a QuEChERS
analytical method was used in combination with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-
tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) to determine the residual levels of fenpyroximate and
its Z-isomer (Z-fenpyroximate) in citrus fruits collected from 12 fields under good agricultural prac-
tices (GAPs). The average recoveries of fenpyroximate in whole fruits and citrus flesh were 104-110%
and 92-109%, respectively, with corresponding RSDs of 1-4% and 1-3%. The average recoveries of
Z-fenpyroximate were 104-113% and 90-91%, respectively, with RSDs of 1-2% in both cases. Each
limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.01 mg kg-1. Fifteen days after application with 56 mg kg-1,
the terminal residues of fenpyroximate in whole fruits and citrus flesh were <0.010-0.18 mg kg-1
and <0.010-0.063 mg kg-1, respectively; the corresponding values for total fenpyroximate (the
sum of fenpyroximate and Z-fenpyroximate) were <0.020-0.19 and <0.020-0.053 mg kg-1. The
levels of terminal fenpyroximate residues in citrus fruit were less than the maximum residue limits
(MRLs) specified in all the existing international standards. In addition, the risk quotients RQc and
RQa were both less than 100%, indicating that the long-term and short-term dietary intake risks
posed to Chinese consumers by fenpyroximate in citrus fruit are both acceptable after a 15-day
harvest interval.

1. Introduction
Citrus belongs to the citrus subfamily of the rutaceae family. Citrus fruits are low in
protein and fat but rich in nutrients such as vitamins, dietary fiber, flavonoids, minerals,
and carotenoids; they provide good health benefits to the human body [1,2]. Globally, citrus
is the most extensively grown category of fruit [3,4]; in China, citrus plants are widely
cultivated in regions such as Hubei, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Shanxi, accounting for about
30% of the world's total citrus production, making China the world's largest producer--and
consumer--of citrus fruits [5,6]. Because citrus plants are perennial, they are vulnerable to
diseases and pests during growth [7]. Any delays or failures in preventative measures can
result in large-scale cross-infections, which may affect yield and quality, and cause slow
growth or death in affected plants.
Fenpyroximate (E isomer; Figure 1) is the common name for tert-butyl (E)-alpha-(1,3)-
dimethyl-5-phenoxy-1H-pyrazol-4-yl methyleneamino-oxy)-para-toluate [8], which was

developed in 1985 by Nihon Noyaku Co. (Tokyo, Japan) [9]. Fenpyroximate has an oxime-
bearing pyrazole structure, and is now widely used as an acaricide. It is characterized by
its strong contact action upon harmful mites such as red spiders and whole-claw spiders,
and it exhibits a high degree of fast-acting acaricidal activity [10]. The action mechanism
of fenpyroximate is different from that of general insecticides; it mainly interferes with
neurophysiological activities, and is inhibitory on nerve conduction; as a result, mites
and insects experience the symptoms of paralysis, inactivity, cessation of food intake,
and, ultimately, death, 2-4 days after coming into contact with fenpyroximate [11]. As a
pesticide, fenpyroximate has the advantages of high efficiency, a broad spectrum, and a
long effective period, with no cross-resistance to other pesticides. In China, fenpyroximate
is currently registered on corn, citrus, apple, and lycium labels [12].

In previous studies, the methods of QuEChERS and micro-solid-phase extraction
(DMSPE), as well as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultra-high-
performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS), have
all been used to analyze the fenpyroximate in fruit juice, apple, tea, ginger, cucumber, green
cabbage, orange, guava, eggplant, herbal medicines, and kiwi fruit [9,10,13-15]. However,
these studies only detected residual levels of the primitive body of fenpyroximate. To date,
no studies have sought to simultaneously detect fenpyroximate and its Z-isomer in citrus;
more specifically, no studies have used multi-regional field trials to assess the dietary intake
risks posed by fenpyroximate and its Z-isomer in citrus fruits.
In the 2013 evaluation report of the FAO/WHO Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues
(JMPR), fenpyroximate was defined as fenpyroximate (E-fenpyroximate) for the risk assess-
ment [16]. However, for the 2017 JMPR report, fenpyroximate was re-evaluated, and a risk
assessment was carried out for a combination of fenpyroximate (E-fenpyroximate) and its
Z-isomer (M-1, Z-fenpyroximate). As a result, it is now a matter of importance to establish
an analytical method to determine the residual behavior of fenpyroximate and its Z-isomer,
and to assess any related dietary intake risks [8].
The objectives of the present study were as follows: (1) To establish a simple and
accurate method of QuEChERS combined with UHPLC-MS/MS to measure fenpyroximate
and its Z-isomer in citrus; (2) to study the terminal residues of fenpyroximate and its
Z-isomer in citrus fruit grown in fields under GAPs; and (3) to carry out a dietary risk
assessment based on the residue data obtained from supervised trials and the dietary
consumption of Chinese residents. In summary, we sought in this work to evaluate the
potential health risk posed to Chinese residents by fenpyroximate ingested from citrus,
and also provide a proposal for the safe and rational use of this pesticide in citrus fruit
cultivation.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Method Validation
A pesticide residue analysis includes sample pre-treatment and sample detection. In
this experiment, we used a flow injection method to inject a mixed standard solution of
Molecules 2023, 28, 7123
3 of 11
fenpyroximate and Z-fenpyroximate into a mass spectrometer at 1 mg/L, and the mass
spectrum was scanned with the positive ionization mode (ESI+) in the MRM mode. By
means of primary mass spectrometry scanning, the value of the parent ion was determined
to be 422.2, and the value of the declustering potential (DP) was optimized so that strongest
signal occurred at 90 V. The values of the pieces were determined to be 366.1 and 135.0 using
product ion scanning. The collision energy (CE) of the mass spectrometry was optimized to
maximize the response of product ions at 23 V and 43 V, respectively. In order to separate the
fenpyroximate and Z-fenpyroximate as much as possible, a slow flow rate of 0.2 mL min-1
was set. Using a single-pesticide standard solution for full scanning, the retention times of
fenpyroximate and its Z-isomer were determined to be 2.71 and 2.28, respectively, under
the mass spectrometry conditions (Table 1); then, a mixed standard solution of the two
pesticides was scanned. As can be seen from the chromatogram shown in Figure 2, and
the total ion chromatogram and MS spectra shown in Figures S1 and S2, respectively, the
method produced a good separation effect. Acetonitrile is a highly polar solvent that
exhibits good solubility with the majority of pesticides and strong permeability to sample
matrixes; it can effectively remove impurities such as oils and pigments from samples [9].
In this study, acetonitrile was used as the extraction solvent for the components to be tested.
In the present study, dispersive solid-phase extraction was used for purification; however,
PSA (N-propyl ethylenediamine), C18, and graphitized carbon black (GCB) have often
been used as purification agents for analyzing pesticide residues in agricultural products.
Farag Malhat [9] described the purification of fenpyroximate in blank guava, orange, and
eggplant samples using PSA and GCB. The satisfactory results reported were due to the
high content of sugars, organic acids, and pigments in citrus. For the present study, PSA
and GCB were selected as purification materials, and the recovery rate was good; the
solution was close to colorless when the levels of PSA and GCB were 50 mg and 5 mg,
respectively.

2.2. Method Validation
In order to analyze the experimental samples accurately, the main parameter indicators
of the analysis methods for the two pesticides in whole fruits and citrus flesh were validated
and evaluated; these parameters included linearity, matrix effect, accuracy, precision, and
sensitivity.
2.2.1. Linearity and Sensitivity
Fenpyroximate and its Z-isomer in two matrixes were verified using linearity, the
correlation coefficient (R2), and the LOQ. As can be seen in Table 2, there was a good linear
relationship between the peak areas and the concentrations of the two tested compounds
in the range of 0.01-0.5 mg kg-1, and the linear correlation coefficients (R2) were greater
than 0.99. The LOQ was identified as the minimum concentration for analyzing the actual
samples that could be determined with acceptable precision and accuracy under the stated
conditions; this was found to be 0.01 mg kg-1 for both compounds in samples of whole
fruit and citrus flesh.

2.2.2. Recovery
To evaluate the accuracy and precision of the detection method, a recovery test was
used to calculate the average recovery and relative standard deviation (RSD) for each of the
two tested compounds in both whole fruit and citrus flesh. The results are shown in Table 3.
It can be seen that the average recoveries of fenpyroximate in the matrixes of whole fruit
and citrus flesh were 104-110% and 92-109%, respectively, with RSDs of 1-4% and 1-3%.
The average recoveries of Z-fenpyroximate were 104-113% and 90-91%, respectively, and
all RSDs were in a range of 1-2%, thus meeting the requirements of accuracy and precision
for the detection method of pesticide residues.

2.2.3. Matrix Effect
Matrix effects (MEs) should be avoided as much as possible when using UHPLC-
MS/MS for residue determination [17]. It can be seen from Table 2 that the whole fruit and
citrus flesh exhibited different levels of a matrix inhibition effect on the two compounds. The
ion suppression percentages of fenpyroximate and Z-fenpyroximate in whole citrus fruit
were -16.8% and -25.8%, respectively; the corresponding ion suppression percentages
in citrus flesh were -12.0% and -6.18%, respectively. Generally, it may be said that
any inhibition or enhancement effect originates from co-extraction compounds such as
phospholipids, sugars, phenols, and pigments. However, the underlying mechanisms of the
matrix effects have not yet been fully explained [18]. Compared to citrus flesh, the matrix
effect of whole citrus fruit was greater, possibly due to the presence of more co-extraction
compounds. In order to eliminate the influence of matrix effects on the detection results,
this experiment uniformly used a matrix-matching standard curve for the quantitative
analysis of substances.
2.3. Terminal Residues
For the terminal residue experiment, fenpyroximate was applied once to citrus from
all twelve fields at the registered high dosage (56 mg kg-1). The terminal residues of
the samples were collected at 15 and 25 days after application, and the total residues of
fenpyroximate were calculated. The results are shown in Tables 4 and S3, and the quality
control (QC) during the actual sample test is shown in Table S2.

In the samples of whole fruit and citrus flesh, the residual amounts of fenpyroximate
were found to be <0.010-0.18 and <0.010-0.063 mg kg-1, respectively; the corresponding
values for total residues were <0.020-0.19 and <0.020-0.053 mg kg-1; in the case of Z-
fenpyroximate, all the values were less than 0.010 mg kg-1. The maximum residue limits
(MRLs) of fenpyroximate in citrus fruits determined by the CAC [19], the United States [20],
and Japan [21] are 0.6, 0.5, and 2 mg kg-1, respectively. In addition, China [22], the
European Union [23], and South Korea [24] have established MRLs for fenpyroximate in
Molecules 2023, 28, 7123
6 of 11
citrus of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.5 mg kg-1, respectively. In this study, the terminal residues in citrus
were found to be below all the above-mentioned limit values.
Throughout the experiment, in both whole fruit and citrus flesh, the residual con-
centrations of fenpyroximate, Z-fenpyroximate, as well as total residues all exhibited a
decreasing trend with increases in the harvest interval. In a small number of cases, the
residue concentrations after long intervals were slightly higher than the corresponding
short-interval values; however, this may have been the result of uneven sampling, quarter-
ing, or scaling during sample preparation so that the experimental results were not affected.
The residual concentrations of fenpyroximate in citrus flesh were lower than those in entire
fruits because droplets of pesticides wholly adhered to the surface of the citrus peel after
application. The total residues of fenpyroximate in whole fruit and citrus flesh were all
derived from fenpyroximate because the chemical configuration of fenpyroximate in plants
gives it an advantage compared to Z-fenpyroximate [25].
2.4. Long-Term Dietary Risk Assessment
The long-term dietary risk assessment was based on data from monitoring surveys on
the nutritional and health status of Chinese residents; these were combined with STMR or
MRL so that a national estimated daily intake (NEDI) could be determined. This was used
to evaluate the dietary intake risk posed by edible parts of foods such as citrus flesh. At
present, based on the data from the Chinese pesticide information network, the crops which
are registered for fenpyroximate in China include maize, citrus, apple, and lycium [12].
In line with the principle of maximizing risk, we used MRLs from countries where crops
are registered for fenpyroximate, with priority given to Chinese standards. As citrus and
apple both belong to the "fruit" classification, a fenpyroximate STMR (total amount) of
0.020 mg kg-1 in citrus flesh collected at 15-day intervals was used in the present study to
represent the fruit classification. The average weight of Chinese adults (bw) is 63 kg, and
the allowable daily intake (ADI) of fenpyroximate is 0.01 mg kg-1 bw [8]. Table 5 shows
the long-term dietary intake risk posed by fenpyroximate in citrus. On the basis of Chinese
dietary data expressed on a per capita basis, the NEDI of fenpyroximate (total amount) for
the general population was calculated to be 3.98 x 10-4 mg kg-1 bw. The value of RQc
was 3.98%, which was considerably less than 100%, indicating that, after a 15-day harvest
interval, the long-term dietary intake risk of fenpyroximate in citrus was very low, and
acceptable for Chinese consumers.

2.5. Short-Term Dietary Risk Assessment
The short-term dietary risk posed by fenpyroximate after the intake of citrus was
assessed for two different groups (children aged 1-6 years, and the general population aged
>6 years). According to data from the World Health Organization [26], the large portion of
dietary consumption (LP) for children in China is 0.587 kg; for the general population, the
figure is 1.014 kg. The unit weight (Ue) of a citrus is 0.124 kg, with a variation factor (u)
of three. The average weight of children aged 1-6 years in China is 16.1 kg; the average
weight of the general population is 63 kg. In this experiment, the highest residue (HR) of
fenpyroximate in citrus was found to be 0.053 mg kg-1. The acute reference dose (ARfD)
Molecules 2023, 28, 7123
7 of 11
is 0.01 mg kg-1 bw [8]. The short-term dietary risks posed by fenpyroximate in citrus to
children aged 1-6 and the general population in China are shown in Table 6. Among the
two groups of people, the national estimated short-term intake (NESTI) of fenpyroximate
was 0.00275 mg kg-1 bw and 0.00106 mg kg-1 bw, respectively. The RQa values were 27.5%
for children and 10.6% for the general population. Both these values were well below 100%,
indicating an acceptable level of dietary intake risk posed by fenpyroximate in citrus, both
to children aged 1-6 and to the general population in China.

3. Materials and Methods
3.1. Reagents and Chemicals
The fenpyroximate standard (Solid, purity 97.79%) and Z-fenpyroximate standard
(liquid, 100.0 ug mL-1) were provided by Dr. Ehrenstorfer (Augsburg, Germany). The 28%
suspension concentrate (SC) of fenpyroximate was supplied by Shanxi Huarongkaiwei
Biotech Co., Ltd. (Xi'an, China). Formic acid and chromatographic-grade methanol were
purchased from Merck AG (Darmstadt, Germany) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., Ltd.
(Shanghai, China), respectively. Acetonitrile and HPLC-grade ammonium acetate were
purchased from Tiandi Co., Ltd. (Dublin, OH, USA) and the Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical
Research Institute (Tianjin, China), respectively. Analytical-grade sodium chloride was
purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Purification
tubes of 2 mL capacity (150 mg anhydrous MgSO4, 50 mg PSA, and 5 mg GCB) were
purchased from Shimadzu Jier Trading Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
A standard stock solution of fenpyroximate was prepared by weighing 10.0 mg of the
fenpyroximate standard and then dissolving it with acetonitrile in a 100 mL volumetric
flask. The standard stock solutions of fenpyroximate and Z-fenpyroximate 100 ug mL-1
were all stored in a freezer at -18 *C.
We placed 0.1 mL of fenpyroximate and Z-fenpyroximate in a 10 mL volumetric flask
with acetonitrile to prepare a mixed standard solution of 10 ug mL-1. The mixed standard
solution was serially diluted with whole fruit and citrus flesh at concentrations of 0.01, 0.02,
0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 ug mL-1. All solutions were stored in a dark place at 4 *C.
3.2. Field Trials
In line with the guideline requirements for the testing of pesticide residues in crops
(NY/T 788-2018) [27], the terminal residue experiment was conducted between September
2022 and January 2023 at 12 locations in China: the city of Longnan in the Gansu province;
the city of Hangzhou in the Zhejiang province; the Zhangjiajie and Changsha cities in
the Hunan province; the city of Lichuan in the Hubei province; the city of Nanning in
the Guangxi province; the district of Beibei in the city of Chongqing; the southwestern
district in the Guizhou province; the city of Yuxi in the Yunnan province; the Guangzhou
and Maoming cities in the Guangdong province; and the city of Danzhou in the Hainan
province. The soil properties and climatic conditions of the field experiment are shown in
Table S1. Tests were carried out in areas with four trees, with isolation zones between the
tested areas and a blank control area to avoid cross-contamination.
In order to measure the levels of terminal and dissipation residue of fenpyroximate
and its Z-isomer, a dosage of 56 mg kg-1 fenpyroximate SC (a registered high dosage in
citrus) was applied once to the citrus. Terminal residue samples of the whole fruit and
citrus flesh were collected 15 d and 25 d after application. Two independent samples were
collected, each involving at least 12 fruits randomly chosen from different places on the tree.
Molecules 2023, 28, 7123

Samples were cut into pieces of less than 1 cm2 and then mixed and divided into pieces of
150 g weight by means of quartering. All samples were stored at -20 *C in preparation for
testing.
3.3. Sample Pre-Treatment
A QuEChERS-based method [28] was used for the pre-treatment of samples in this
experiment. Uniformly crushed samples were weighed (10.00 g of both whole fruit and
citrus flesh) and placed into a 50 mL centrifuge tube, to which 10 mL acetonitrile and 5.0 g
sodium chloride were added. Extraction was carried out for 10 min at 2500 rpm using
vortex oscillation, followed by centrifuging at 8000 r min-1 for 3 min. A 1.5 mL amount
of supernatant 1.5 mL was sucked out and transferred to a 2 mL centrifuge tube filled
with 150 mg anhydrous MgSO4, 50 mg PSA, and 5 mg GCB. The tubes were vortexed at
2500 rpm for 5 min and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 2 min. Finally, the purified liquid was
filtered through a 0.22 um membrane filter for analysis via UHPLC-MS/MS.
3.4. Instrumental Parameters
Chromatographic conditions: UHPLC-MS/MS analyses of fenpyroximate and its
Z-isomer were carried out using SCIEX Triple Quad 4500 (AB company, Framingham,
MA, USA). The chromatographic column was ACQUITY UPLC(r) BEH 1.7 um C18 100 A
(100 x 2.1 mm, SN: 02973711615165). The temperatures of the column and sample plate
were 30 *C and 20 *C, respectively. The mobile phase was composed of 90% aqueous phase
(4 mmol L-1 ammonium acetate aqueous solution with 0.1% formic acid) and 10% organic
phase (pure methanol), flowing at 0.2 mL min-1. The injection volume was 2 uL.
Mass spectrum conditions: The mass spectrum was scanned at positive ionization
mode (ESI+) in MRM mode. The ionization voltage was 5500 V, the ion source temperature
was 550 *C, and the collision gas was nitrogen. The other mass-spectrometry parameters
for fenpyroximate and its Z-isomer are shown in Table 1.
3.5. Method Validation
The analytical methods used for fenpyroximate and Z-fenpyroximate in whole fruit
and citrus flesh were verified with respect to linearity, matrix effect (ME), accuracy, precision,
and sensitivity, in conformity with SANTE/11312/2021 [29]. The mixed standard solutions
were diluted with blanks of whole citrus fruit, blanks of flesh citrus, and acetonitrile, to
prepare a series of standard working solutions with concentrations of 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1,
0.2, and 0.5 ug mL-1. A calibration curve was then drawn with the mass concentration as
the X-axis and the corresponding peak area as the Y-axis; the linear correlation coefficient
R2 was expected to be more than 0.99.
Three levels of mixed standard solutions (0.01, 0.1, and 0.2 mg kg-1) were added to
blank matrixes of whole fruit and citrus flesh, so that the recovery and relative standard
deviation (RSD) values could be calculated for the target compounds, enabling the accuracy
and precision of the method to be evaluated. In order to cover the maximum detected
concentration among the testing samples, we added a concentration of 0.5 mg kg-1 to
the whole fruit matrix. Five repeated tests were carried out for each level. The recovery
rate of the method was found to be 70-120%, and the RSD was less than 20%, which was
considered a satisfactory degree of accuracy. Usually, the lowest spiked level was set as the
limit of quantification (LOQ) to evaluate the sensitivity of the method.
As reported in the literature [30,31], the ion suppression percentage is commonly used
to evaluate matrix effects with the following calculation formula:
Ion suppression percentage = (Km -Ks)/Ks
(1)
where Km and Ks are the slopes of the matrix-matched standard curve and the solvent
standard curve, respectively. An ion suppression percentage of 0 indicates no matrix
effect; an ion suppression percentage of more than 0 indicates that the sample matrix has a
matrix-enhancing effect on the determination of the target compound; and ion suppression

percentages of less than 0 indicates a matrix-inhibiting effect on the determination of the
target compound.
3.6. Definitions of Fenpyroximate
For plant commodities, in line with the JMPR research results, the residue was defined
as fenpyroximate for compliance with MRLs, and for the dietary risk assessment as the
sum of the parent fenpyroximate and its Z-isomer (M-1), expressed as fenpyroximate and
calculated directly using addition [8].
3.7. Assessment of Long-Term Dietary Intake Risk
The method for assessing long-term dietary intake risk was recommended by the
review committee of the National Pesticide Residue Standards. The risk quotient (RQc)
was used to represent the long-term dietary intake risk, and the calculation formulas were
as follows [32]:
NEDI = (STMRi x Fi)/bw
(2)
RQc = NEDI/ADI x 100%
(3)
where NEDI (mg kg-1 bw) refers to the national estimated daily intake; STMRi (mg kg-1) is
the median residue of total fenpyroximate (the sum of fenpyroximate and Z-fenpyroximate)
in citrus flesh collected from field trials; Fi (kg d-1) is the per capita daily consumption
of citrus in China; bw (kg) is the average weight of Chinese adults; ADI (mg kg-1 bw) is
the allowable daily intake of fenpyroximate taken as determined by the Joint FAO/WHO
Meeting of Pesticide Residues (JMPR) [8]. A result of RQc <=100% indicates that the
level of risk is acceptable to consumers, whereas RQc > 100% indicates a level which is
unacceptable.
3.8. Assessment of Short-Term Dietary-Intake Risk
Assessment of short-term dietary intake risk was calculated in line with case 2a of the
JMPR-recommended method using the following formulas [32]:
NESTI = [Ue x HR x u + (LP -Ue) x HR]/bw
(4)
RQa = NESTI/ArfD x 100%
(5)
where NESTI (mg kg-1 bw) refers to the national estimated short-term intake; HR (mg kg-1)
is the highest total of fenpyroximate residue in citrus flesh collected from field trials; Ue (kg)
is the weight of a single orange; u is a variation factor; LP (kg) represents a large portion
of dietary consumption; Bw (kg) is the average weight of the consumer population; and
ARfD (mg kg-1 bw) is the acute reference dose taken from JMPR [8,12]. The short-term
dietary-intake risk value is expressed as RQa. When RQa <=100%, short-term dietary risk is
at an acceptable level; when RQa > 100%, the level of risk is not acceptable.
4. Conclusions
In this study, a qualitative and quantitative method of analysis was established to de-
tect fenpyroximate and its Z-isomer in whole-fruit and flesh citrus. This method was found
to be simple, time-saving, effective in purification, sensitive, and accurate. This method
is characterized by an excellent linear relationship, with levels of accuracy and precision
which meet the requirements for detection and analysis of pesticide residues. Using this
method, we obtained a short-term separation of fenpyroximate and its Z-isomer, and the
effect of the separation was good. The terminal residues of fenpyroximate in whole-fruit
and flesh citrus collected from twelve fields were <0.010-0.18 and <0.010-0.063 mg kg-1,
respectively, which were lower than the Chinese MRL values. The terminal residues of
fenpyroximate (the sum of fenpyroximate and Z-fenpyroximate) in whole-fruit and flesh
citrus were <0.020-0.19 and <0.020-0.053 mg kg-1, respectively, and RQc and RQa were
3.98% and 10.6-27.5%, respectively, i.e., less than 100%, indicating that the levels of long-

term and short-term dietary-intake risk posed to Chinese consumers by fenpyroximate in
citrus were acceptable, given a 15-day harvest interval after application at 56 mg kg-1. In
conclusion, this study provides a scientific basis for the safe use of fenpyroximate in citrus
as well as basic data for revising the MRL values.
